<p>It is not possible to say, with any degree of certainty, at what
precise period our ancient British forefathers acquired a knowledge
of the art of coining, or into what part of our island
that art was first introduced. The probability, however, amounting
almost to a certainty, is that the use of money and, consequently,
the art of making it, was introduced into Britain from
Gaul; and the Kentish coast being the nearest to that country,
and receiving friendly and bartering incursions from the
Belgic tribes, with whom, doubtless, the natives traded, the
natural assumption is that money was known to, and its use
appreciated by, the inhabitants of that county long before those
of the inland and more northern parts of the island had any
knowledge of such a medium as a substitute for ordinary product-barter.
Kent may therefore, I apprehend, be looked upon as
the district in which money made its first appearance in our
country; and, probably, where also it was first made by our
Celtic progenitors.</p>

</div>

<p>The period which may, with more than ordinary probability;
be assigned to the adoption of a home-struck currency among
the tribes of our country, is also, naturally, a matter about which
only a vague conclusion can be arrived at. The conclusion,
however, that has been come to after the most assiduous and
searching attention to and consideration of every possible circumstance
of locality, analogy of types, and weight, is that that
period may be fixed at from a hundred and fifty to two hundred
years before the birth of Christ. This, then, for general purposes
may be looked upon as the most closely approximate period that
the present state of our knowledge has enabled those numismatists
who have made this branch of the science their special
study to arrive at.</p>

<p>The type of supposed earliest coins of the Britons, derived,
there can be no doubt, from those of Gaul, to which they had
become accustomed, are uninscribed; those of Gaul having, in
turn, originally and long before the days of Julius Cæsar, been
derived from the <i>stater</i> of Philippus of Macedon. This has been
ably shown and insisted upon by various writers, and to it Mr.
Evans, the highest and most enlightened authority upon the
subject, has given his full adhesion. The Phocæan colony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Massilia (Marseilles), he says, “appears to have formed the
centre from which civilization spread through Gaul, as well as
to have been the emporium of its commerce. It was founded
about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 600, and from intercourse with its inhabitants the
neighbouring Gauls first learned the usages of civilized life, and
after a time became acquainted with the art of coining. The
early silver coins of Massilia (and none in gold are known) were
occasionally imitated in the surrounding country; but when, about
the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 356, the gold mines of Crenides (or Philippi) were
acquired by Philip II. of Macedon, and worked so as to produce
about £250,000 worth of gold annually, the general currency
of gold coins, which had before been of very limited extent,
became much more extensive, and the <i>stater</i> of Philip&mdash;the
<i>regale numisma</i> of Horace&mdash;became everywhere diffused, and
seems at once to have been seized on by the barbarians who
came in contact with Greek civilization as an object of imitation.
In Gaul this was especially the case, and the whole of
the gold coinage of that country may be said to consist of
imitations, more or less rude and degenerate, of the Macedonian
Philippus.”</p>

<p>The types of the Philippus are, on the obverse, a laureated
profile bust of Apollo, or young Hercules, and, on the reverse,
a charioteer in a biga, and the earliest Gaulish imitations are
tolerably closely, though more rudely, rendered. These, naturally,
were introduced, and became known, to the Britons,
who, as naturally, imitated them, as their neighbours had done
the originals. But these imitations were not always servile,
but had occasionally additional features, as drapery, a torque
round the neck, a bandlet, or what not. The constant reproducing
of the dies by different workmen and in different
localities also resulted in the original design being at length

almost lost, and what now, to the uninitiated, appear a lot of
unmeaning pellets and curved strokes, serve only as indications,
or faint traces, of the original. Here, upon the coins (p. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>), is
an example. First is the <i>stater</i> of Philip of Macedon, with
laureated bust and biga; next a British coin on which there is
an attempted reproduction of the head on one side, and a rude
imitation of horse and driver on the other; and on the third a
very degenerate example, on which only a trace of each is discernible.
These three, out of hundreds of examples, will serve
to show the descent of the type and the changes to which the
design has been subjected. Other types shared the same fate,
and thus the correct appropriation of Celtic coins becomes a
matter of no little difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
It is well to remember, as evidenced by these gradual marks
of degeneration, that the ruder coins are not, as might well be
(and indeed have usually been) supposed, the oldest, but are,
in fact, later than others of a higher and more artistic character.
In other words, some of these series of coins, instead of showing
the onward and gradual progress of art from a first rude attempt
up to a highly finished work, serve to exhibit step by step its
gradual degeneracy and decline down to ultimate extinction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 231px;">
<a href="images/i_005_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_005_small.jpg" width="231" height="300" alt="coins" /></a>
</div>

<p>Other coins were more or less imitations of Roman coins, but
others again have a true native character about them that shows
that the Briton, who was an admirable and accomplished worker
in metals, was also a clever die-sinker, and had in him considerable
power of design.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p>Celtic coins are usually considered under two classes, the
uninscribed and the inscribed&mdash;that is, those which are without
any inscriptions, and those upon which names or other letters
occur&mdash;and it seems to be a generally received opinion that
whenever an inscribed currency was in use, an uninscribed one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had preceded it. The uninscribed are, unfortunately, the most
abundant, and therefore, manifestly, it is impossible to judge by
them to what princes or tribes they belong. The geographical
arrangement&mdash;that of classifying the types according to the
localities in which they have been found&mdash;has therefore, as a
general and very convenient rule, to be adopted. Some coins,
as the one here engraved from my own collection, have the
convex side perfectly plain, while the reverse, concave, side bears
a more or less rude representation of a horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="smcap"><i>Figs.</i> A-J, TYPES OF</span><br />
<span class="smcap">ANCIENT BRITISH COINS.</span></div>
</div>

<p>“Although we have assigned the date of about 150 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> for the
commencement of the British coinage,” Mr. Evans remarks, “it is
hard to say with any degree of certainty in what part of the
country it actually commenced. The study of this class of coins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is to some extent like that of geology: we have no written
testimony on which to fall back, and the annals of the past have
to be reconstructed from the evidence of contemporary yet dumb
witnesses disinterred from the soil. But the numismatist has
none of those aids which the geologist derives from the order
of superposition, and the mineral characters of the rocks in
which his fossils are preserved; and, in the case of uninscribed
coins, has nothing but the type and its geographical range on
which to found any conclusion, unless, as in some rare instances
it happens, the coins are associated with others of more certain
date. The mere fact of finding a single coin of a certain class
in a certain locality proves nothing; but when a considerable
number of coins of much the same type are found at different
times in places all within a certain district, the proof becomes
almost conclusive that they were originally struck within that
district. And this holds true even with gold coins, which, from
their greater value and relative portability, have, as a rule, a
much wider range than those of silver or copper.”</p>

<p>The districts into which it has been found most convenient
(and undoubtedly as presenting an arrangement that may be
looked upon as practically correct) to classify the inscribed coins
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I now proceed to enumerate some of the inscribed coins
referred to under the geographical arrangement already given.</p>


<h3>BODVOC.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i_010_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_010_small.jpg" width="300" height="125" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p>Coins bearing the word <span class="f90">BODVOC</span>, <span class="f90">BODVO</span>, or <span class="f90">ODVOC</span>, have
usually, but erroneously, been ascribed to Boadicea, Queen of
the Iceni. As is remarked by Evans, “there is no ground for
supposing that any coins were struck by Boadicea, who never
seems to have exercised the queenly power, unless as the leader
of a short-lived revolt, and whose chief complaint against the
Romans was, that the kingdom left by her husband Prasutagus,
to which possibly she may have hoped to succeed, was overrun
and pillaged by their troops, she herself scourged, and her
daughters put to shame.” Moreover, no coins of <span class="f90">BODVOC</span> have
ever been found in the Icenian territory, but are confined to the
opposite side of the country; and are evidently of a date
anterior to the revolt of Boadicea. The usual type has on the
<i>obverse</i> simply the word <span class="f90">BODVOC</span> in large letters across the
field; <i>reverse</i>, a horse of more or less disjointed character, with
chariot-wheel and other details. One example has, however,
on the <i>obverse</i> a profile bust to the left, and letters <span class="f90">BODVO</span> in
front of the face; and <i>reverse</i>, a horse, etc.</p>


<h3>CATTI.</h3>

<p>A convex coin. <i>Obverse</i>, an object which may be described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
as a branch, or a spike of flowers; <i>reverse</i>, a disjointed horse,
chariot-wheel, etc., and the letters <span class="f90">CATTI</span>.</p>


<h3>COMVX.</h3>

<p>Much the same as the last, with the letters, on <i>reverse</i>, <span class="f90">COMVX</span>.</p>


<h3>VO-CORIO.</h3>

<p>The reading of these is doubtful. The coins are much the
same as the last, with the letters <span class="f90">VO-CORIO</span> over the horse on the
<i>reverse</i>. One variety has the additional letters <span class="smcap">A D</span> in front of
the horse’s head, and another also a <span class="f90">D</span> by its legs; thus the
continuous inscription would be <span class="f90">VOCORIOADD</span>, but is at present
uninterpretable.</p>


<h3>ANTEDRIGVS.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, same as the last; <i>reverse</i>, disjointed horse, with
chariot-wheel and other objects, and the letters <span class="f90">ANTEDRIGV</span>, or
<span class="f90">ANTE[BO]</span> <span class="f90">I. OV.</span> Another type has, <i>obverse</i>, a barbarous attempt
at a head; and <i>reverse</i>, a horse as usual, with the letters
<span class="f90">ANTE[BO]</span>, or <span class="f90">ANTED</span>, or <span class="f90">ANTE[BO]RI</span>, etc.</p>


<h3>INMA, INAM, or INARA.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i_011_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_011_small.jpg" width="300" height="117" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, as before; <i>reverse</i>, disjointed horse, with chariot-wheel,
etc., and the letters <span class="f90">INMA</span>, <span class="f90">INAM</span>, or more probably
<span class="f90">INARA</span>.</p>


<h3>SVEI.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, barbarous attempt at a head; <i>reverse</i>, disjointed
horse, and letters <span class="f90">SV</span> above, and <span class="f90">EI</span> beneath the horse. Probably
struck by some British regulus whose name began with <span class="f90">SVEI</span>.</p>


<h3>COMMIVS (?).</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, rude attempt at a head; <i>reverse</i>, disjointed horse,
with chariot-wheel, etc., and the letters <span class="f90">MMIOS</span>, or <span class="f90">OMMIOS</span>.</p>


<h3>TINC[OMMIVS].</h3>

<p>A son of Commivs. <i>Obverse</i>, on some, portions of a rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bust; on others, <span class="f90">TINC</span> on a sunk tablet; others, <span class="f90">COM</span>, or <span class="f90">COM·F</span>,
on a similar sunk tablet; others, <span class="f90">TINCOM</span>, or <span class="f90">NCOM</span>, etc., between
zigzag and corded lines across the field; others, <span class="f90">TINC</span> on a
tablet, above which is <span class="f90">C</span> and below <span class="f90">F</span>, etc. <i>Reverse</i>, on some, a
rude, disjointed horse, with the letters, <span class="f90">TINC COMMI F</span>; others, a
horse as before, with <span class="f90">TIN DV</span>; others, of a higher class of art, a
horseman poising a javelin, and charging to the left, with <span class="f90">C F</span>
below and a star above; others, horseman with javelin as before,
and <span class="f90">TIN</span>; another, a winged head of Medusa, which unique
coin is in Mr. Evans’s cabinet; others, a horse and <span class="f90">TIN</span>; and
other varieties.</p>


<h3>VERICA, or VIRICA.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/i_012b_small.jpg" width="300" height="152" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p>A son of Commivs. <i>Obverse</i>, an expanded five-lobed leaf, or
a cluster of five oak leaves, with <span class="f90">VI</span> on one side, and <span class="f90">RI</span> on the
other; a sunk tablet of various forms, with the letters <span class="f90">COM·F</span>;
<span class="f90">VERI·COM·F</span> in two lines; <span class="f90">VERICA COMMI F</span> encircling a
circular shield, or other object; <span class="f90">COM F</span> between crescents with
horns facing inwards; a semi-draped seated figure, with
<span class="f90">VERICA</span>; a filleted bust with <span class="f90">VIRRI</span>; and others, examples of
which are here engraved. <i>Reverse</i>, on some a horseman
galloping or leaping, with <span class="f90">CO·F</span>, <span class="f90">VIR REX</span>, or <span class="f90">VIR</span>; a riderless
horse with <span class="f90">REX</span>, <span class="f90">VI</span>, <span class="f90">VIR</span>; a lion with <span class="f90">VIR</span>; a trophy of an
attempted imitation of the Roman caduceus between two cornucopiæ,
rising from a two-handled vase, and <span class="f90">COMMI F</span>; a
capricorn, with <span class="f90">EPPI COM F</span>, etc.;
this latter being very remarkable as
bearing the names of the two brothers
Verica and Eppillus. Another variety
has a horseman on each side, with
<span class="f90">COM F</span> on the <i>obverse</i>, and <span class="f90">VERICA</span> on
the <i>reverse</i>; and another, a diademed and draped bust on one
side with <span class="f90">VIRI</span>, and on the other, a seated figure of Victory (?),
as here engraved.</p>

<img src="images/i_013_small.jpg" width="300" height="122" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p>One of the sons of Commius, and brother to Tinc[ommius]
and Verica. His name occurs in various stages of abbreviation,
<span class="f90">EPPILLVS</span>, <span class="f90">EPPIL</span>, <span class="f90">EPPI</span>, <span class="f90">EPP</span>, and <span class="f90">EP</span>. <i>Obverse</i>, on some the
name <span class="f90">EPPIL COM F</span> in two lines across the coin; others, a
circular wreath inclosing <span class="f90">COM F</span>; or winged figure of Victory
within a wreath; or a beaded band and a line of foliage in
saltire, with the four letters <span class="f90">E P P I</span>, one on each of the angles of
the cross; or a diademed head; or an eagle rising with <span class="f90">EPP</span>;
or an ornamental cross, with <span class="f90">EPPI COM F</span> between the limbs
(p.<a href="#Page_6">6</a>, Fig. <span class="f90">E</span>); or a bull, evidently copied from the coin of
Augustus, here engraved. <i>Reverse</i>, a winged horse, or Pegasus;

<span class="f90">EPPI</span>, and a quatrefoil or other ornaments; or undraped standing
winged figure, with <span class="f90">EP</span>; or a crescent between two clusters of
pellets, with <span class="f90">REX CALLE</span> (supposed to allude to Calleva&mdash;Silchester&mdash;as
place of mintage); and other varieties.</p>


<h3>DVBNOVELLAVNVS.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, on some a device (placed diagonally across the coin)
that may almost be taken to be the thunderbolt of Jove,
between two circles that <i>may</i> be the wheel of Nemesis, the
emblem of swift and retributive justice, as not unfrequently
represented in Roman art; or a laureated head, with <span class="f90">DVBNO</span>;
or other device. <i>Reverse</i>, on some a horse with or without a
wreath or branch below and other minor devices, with the
letters <span class="f90">DVBNO</span> ..., <span class="f90">[DV]BNOVELL</span> ..., <span class="f90">DVBNOVIILLA</span>,
<span class="f90">[DVBNO]VIILLAVN</span>, or <span class="f90">DVBNO[VELLA]VNOS</span>; or a griffin, or
ornithocephalous winged horse with star and other ornaments;
or a horse with <span class="f90">DVBN</span> in a tablet; or other varieties.</p>


<h3>VOSE[NOS] (?).</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, plain convex. <i>Reverse</i>, a horse, above which is a
bull’s head and a ring ornament; and, beneath, what has been
described as a “horned serpent,” but may be a torque or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
object, with ... <span class="f90">NOS</span>; or a horse with other accompaniments,
and <span class="f90">VOSII</span>.</p>


<h3>AMMINVS.</h3>

</div>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, a bust to the right, with or

<h3>CRAB.</h3>

<p>Only two coins, according to Mr. Evans, are known bearing
this name, or rather commencement of a name, the remainder of
which is unknown. One of the two known examples bears on
the <i>obverse</i> a cross whose limbs are formed of three rows of
beads, with central ring, and in the angles between the limbs
of the cross the letters <span class="f90">C R A B</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, an eagle rising
regardant. The other has, <i>obverse</i>, the letters <span class="f90">C R A B</span> on a
tablet, above which is an annulet, and, below, an S-shaped

</div>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, on some, bust to the right, with the letters <span class="f90">ANDOCO</span>;

beaded fillets, and other of two torque-like figures, more or less
developed and accompanied by other minor marks (p.<a href="#Page_6">6</a>, Fig. <span class="f90">B</span>);
or a bearded profile bust with a, etc. <i>Reverse</i>, a horse, with
<span class="f90">ANDOCO</span>; or a horse with a bull’s head above, and <span class="f90">ANDO</span>; or a

<h3>TASCIOVANVS.</h3>

<p>Ascertained from numismatic evidence to have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
father of Cunobelinus and of Epaticcus, is supposed to have
reigned some quarter of a century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, with his capital fixed at
Verulamium, and to have died somewhere about 5 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> <i>Obverse</i>,
on some, a double cruciform device of the same general character
as the last described, but of more or less disjointed and imperfect
execution (p.<a href="#Page_6">6</a>, Fig. <span class="f90">H</span>); or a somewhat similar device, with
the letters <span class="f90">TASCI</span> between the limbs of the cross; or <span class="f90">TASC</span> on an
oblong tablet with lines extended from its angles, and forming,
with a beaded band, etc., a kind of cruciform ornament; or <span class="f90">TASC</span>
within an oblong tablet surrounded by a beaded circle; or a
beaded bust to the left; or a laureated bust, with <span class="f90">TASCIA</span>; or a
Pegasus, with <span class="f90">TAS</span>; or an eagle, wings closed, regardant,
with <span class="f90">TASCIA</span>; or a bust to the right, with <span class="f90">TASCIAVA</span>; and
others. <i>Reverse</i>, on some, a horse with various accompaniments,
with <span class="f90">TASCIOVAN</span>, <span class="f90">[T]ASCIAV</span>, <span class="f90">TAXCI</span>, <span class="f90">TASCIA</span>, or <span class="f90">TASC</span>,
etc.; or a mounted horseman, with various contractions of the
name; or a figure of Pegasus; or a bull with tail over back
and head as in act of tossing, as on the coin of Augustus (already
referred to under Eppillus), from which it has evidently been
copied; or a winged griffin; or a boar; or other device.</p>


<h3>VERVLAMIVM.</h3>

<p>The coins of Verulamium, the ancient city of Verulam, near
St. Albans, the capital of the Catyeuchlani, and a place of
mintage during some period of time, are tolerably numerous in
their types and of considerable interest. Its name as a place
of mintage first appears upon the coins of Silvanus; on the
gold in extremely small characters, but more conspicuously
upon the silver and copper pieces. On some of the latter we
have the name of the town alone, without that of the prince,
but the types are so connected with those which bear the name
of Tasciovanus that it is evident the apparently autonomous
coins must have been issued during his reign. Among the
abbreviated forms of the name of the city upon coins there struck
are <span class="f90">V</span>, <span class="f90">VER</span>, <span class="f90">VIIR</span>, and <span class="f90">VERLAMIO</span>, and these occur in connection
with, or separate from, other inscriptions. The <i>obverse</i> of
one, bearing the letters <span class="f90">VERLAMIO</span> between the points of the
limbs of a double cruciform ornament, is engraved on (p.<a href="#Page_6">6</a>,
Fig. <span class="f90">J</span>).</p>


<h3>TASCIO RICON.</h3>

<p>Coins bearing the letters&mdash;</p>

<p>and the like, in two lines divided from each other in a tablet
across the field of the coin, appear to have been struck by Tasciovanus
at some town of mintage indicated by <span class="f90">RICON</span>, but which
has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained.</p>


<h3>SEGO.</h3>

<p>Coins bearing the letters <span class="f90">SEGO</span> on a tablet, with or without
the <span class="f90">TASCIO</span> of Tasciovanus, would seem to have been struck by
him at some place, or recording some tribe, not yet accurately
appropriated.</p>


<h3>EPATICCVS.</h3>

<p>One of the sons of Tasciovanus and brother of Cunobeline.
<i>Obverse</i>, on some, an ear of bearded coin and the letters <span class="f90">TASCI F</span>;
or a head of Hercules, and <span class="f90">EPATI</span> or <span class="f90">EPAT</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, on some
a nude mounted horseman, with lance and shield, and <span class="f90">EPATICCV</span>;
or an eagle standing on a serpent, etc.</p>


<h3>CVNOBELINVS.</h3>

<p>The “Cymbeline” of Shakespeare, a son of Tasciovanus and
brother of Epaticcus, and during whose reign the birth of our
Saviour took place, struck a considerable variety of coins
in all the metals. He had Camulodunum (Colchester) for his
capital and place of mintage. Of his sons Togodumnos and
Caractacus no coins are known. The coins of Cunobeline are
so numerous and varied that it is not necessary to summarize
their types. The following are examples of the inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<h3>ADDEDOMAROS.</h3>

<p>Possibly partly contemporary with Cunobeline. <i>Obverse</i>, on
some a singular device partaking of the conventional form of the
“Thunderbolt of Jove,” as before alluded to; on others, a six-limbed
device, the limbs curved in “Catherine-wheel” form,
and springing from three central crescents, rings and pellets in
the angles; or a cross with beaded lines and two crescents (p.<a href="#Page_6">6</a>,
Fig. <span class="f90">C</span>). <i>Reverse</i>, on some, a horse with or without branch beneath,
and with or without wheel, and other rude ornaments,
and <span class="f90">ADDEDO-MARVS</span>, or <span class="f90">ADDEDO</span>, or A[BO][BO]IIDO[<span class="f90">M</span>], or other
abbreviations.</p>


<h3>THE ICENI.</h3>

<img src="images/i_017_small.jpg" width="300" height="126" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p>A number of inscribed coins about which nothing certain is
known have, with considerable show of reason, been attributed
generally to the Iceni. Their types are very varied, and need
not be recapitulated. Among the inscriptions are the following:&mdash;<span class="f90">ECE</span>
or <span class="f90">ECEN</span> (probably for <span class="f90">ICEN</span>), <span class="f90">AESV</span>, <span class="f90">SAEMV</span> or <span class="f90">SAFMV</span>,
<span class="f90">ANTD</span> or <span class="f90">ANTED</span>, <span class="f90">CAV</span> ... <span class="f90">DVRO</span>
(possibly <span class="f90">DVRO-CAM[BORICVM]</span>), etc.,
etc. Many varieties of uninscribed
coins are also, with more or less show
of reason, attributed to the Iceni.
The <i>obverse</i> of one example is engraved on (p.<a href="#Page_6">6</a>, Fig. i).</p>


<h3>THE BRIGANTES.</h3>

<p>A number of coins have, with plausible reasoning, been
appropriated by Mr. Evans and other authorities, to the Brigantes,
whose dominions seem to have comprised Yorkshire,
Lancashire, and other northern parts, and who are indeed said
to have been the original inhabitants, the Britons proper, of the
island, who had been driven inland and northwards by successive
invaders of the soil, and they seem to have been among
the latest to retain the original national characteristics. Among
the inscribed coins (which are of unusual rudeness) believed to
have belonged to them, are those bearing the letters <span class="f90">VO·LI·SI·OS<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></span>
on the <i>obverse</i>, and <span class="f90">DVM NOCO VEROS</span>, or <span class="f90">DVMNO CO VEROS</span>, on
the <i>reverse</i>; <span class="f90">DVMNOVERO</span>; <span class="f90">IISVPSV</span>; <span class="f90">VEP</span>, <span class="f90">VEP CORF</span>, or <span class="f90">VEP
RF</span>; <span class="f90">DVMN</span> on <i>obverse</i>, and <span class="f90">TIGIP-SENO</span> on <i>reverse</i>; <span class="f90">AVNT</span> or
<span class="f90">AVN-T</span>, the <span class="f90">AVN</span> being over the back of the horse, and the <span class="f90">T</span>
beneath its neck.</p>


<h3>CHANNEL ISLANDS.</h3>

<p>A number of types of rude uninscribed coins, partaking of
the character of those of Gaulish origin, mostly in billon, but
sometimes of silver or bronze, are ascribed to the Channel
Islands, and numbers of them have been found in Jersey and
other islands, as well as in our own country. The examples
engraved are in my own possession, and were found, with
others, in Devonshire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i_018_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_018_small.jpg" width="300" height="242" alt="coins" /></a>
</div>

<p>The usual type is a boldly cut, but rudely designed, head, a
coarse imitation of the Greek already referred to; and the
<i>reverse</i> a horse more or less disjointed or disintegrated, and
accompanied by indications, more or less distinct, of wheels and
other objects.</p>

<p>As indicating to some extent the area over which the coins of
the ancient Britons circulated, it may be said that the approximate
number of <i>recorded</i> localities in which “finds” have been
made in the “forty shires” may be summarized as most of all
in Kent (say forty places); about half that number in Dorset,
Sussex, and Essex; about a third in Oxfordshire; say a fourth
in Suffolk, Surrey, Buckingham, Hampshire, Herts, and
Northampton; and so decreasing in Beds., Cambs., and Norfolk;
Berks, Middlesex, and Gloucester; Wilts and Somerset;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Lincolnshire and Yorkshire; Leicestershire, Monmouthshire,
and Worcestershire; and Devonshire, Cornwall, Huntingdon,
Lancashire, Northumberland, Nottingham, and Westmoreland.
Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and the other counties not enumerated,
not having, so far as at present known to me, produced a single
<i>recorded</i> example.</p>

<h2><a name="COINS_OF_THE_ANGLO-SAXONS" id="COINS_OF_THE_ANGLO-SAXONS"></a>COINS OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS.</h2>


<p>The earliest coins of the Anglo-Saxon period appear to have
been rude imitations of some of the later current pieces of their
Roman predecessors in our island. It seems doubtful whether
at first they had a coinage of their own, the probability being
that those of the Romano-Britons continued, as they naturally
would, to be circulated. Some of the sceattæ bear more or
less rude figures and uncouth heads and devices, some being
evident imitations of the well-known type of Romulus and
Remus suckled by the she-wolf, and others of equally well known
types. From the sceattæ, one of our common expressions at
the present is derived. The word in the singular is <i>sceat</i> or
<i>scæt</i>, and the Saxon <i>sc</i> being pronounced soft, as <i>sh</i>, became
<i>sheat</i> or <i>shæt</i>. From this it naturally became corrupted into
“shot,” and thus “paying your shot” simply meant paying
your money, or clearing your reckoning, and “not having a
shot in your locker,” being without money in cupboard, or purse.
These early coins, some of which appear to bear Runic characters,
cannot with any degree of certainty be appropriated to any
kings.</p>

<p>The penny, <i>penig</i>, <i>pening</i>, or <i>pending</i> (said to be the diminutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of <i>pand</i>, a pledge, and also by some said to be derived from
<i>pendere</i>, to weigh) is first named in the laws of Ina, king of the
West Saxons, who began to reign <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 688. It was, as now, as
has been conclusively shown, the 240th part of a pound, which
weighed about 5760 grains; the weight of a penny was, therefore,
24 grains, which still in our tables constitute a “dwt.” or
“pennyweight.”</p>

<p>The generally received opinion is that the first pennies as
succeeding the sceattæ; and quite independent of the stycas, were
struck by Offa, king of Mercia, from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 757 to 796. “When
the kingdoms of the Heptarchy were united in one sovereignty,”
as I have written on another occasion, “the mints were regulated
by laws framed by the Wittenagemote, or Great Council
of the Nation; but it was not till the time of Æthelstan (924-940),
that it was appointed there should be one kind of money
throughout the whole realm, and that no one should coin but in
a town. According to Stow, ‘Æthelstan made, seven coining
mints at Canterbury, four for the king, two for the archbishop,
and one for the abbot; at Rochester three, two for the king,
and one for the bishop. Besides these, in London eight, in
Winchester six, in Lewes two, in Chichester one, in Hampton
two, in Shaftesbury two, and in every other town one coiner.’
The coins remaining pretty well prove this, and show there
were very few considerable towns without a mint; for besides
those particularly mentioned in Æthelstan’s law, there are coins
of Derby, Bristol, Evesham, Exeter, Gloucester, Ipswich,
Lincoln, Norwich, Shrewsbury, Thetford, Wallingford, Worcester,
York, and other places. The probability is that the
custom of impressing on coins the name of the town of the
mintage began in the early part of the reign of Æthelstan.”</p>

<p>One of the largest “finds” of Anglo-Saxon coins was made
at Cuerdale, where, along with a vast number of foreign pieces,
there were found:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>2 of Æthelred.</li>
    <li>24 of Æthelstan II.</li>
    <li>1 of Ciolwulf.</li>
    <li>857 of Alfred.</li>
    <li>45 of Eadwerd.</li>
    <li>1 of Abp. Ceolnoth.</li>
    <li>59 of Abp. Plegmund.</li>
    <li>2 of Sitric.</li>
    <li>1770 of St. Eadmund.</li>
    <li>etc.</li></ul>


<p>Under the ordinary order of arrangement, the following may
be taken as indications of the coins of Anglo-Saxon rulers:&mdash;</p>


<h3><i>KINGS OF KENT.</i> ÆTHILBERHT I., 725-764.</h3>

<p>The <i>sceat</i> attributed to this king is doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<h3>EGCBERHT, 765-791.</h3>

<p>The name is found as <span class="f90">EGCBERHT RX.</span> and on the <i>reverse</i> is
the moneyer’s name.</p>


<h3>EADBEARHT, 794-798.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, the name <span class="f90">EADBEARHT REX</span> in three lines across the
field.</p>

<p><i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s name with device.</p>


<h3>CUTHRED, 798-805.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, on some a profile bust, others three arms branching
out from the inner circle, and extending through the legend,
<span class="f90">CVDRED REX</span> or <span class="f90">CVDRED REX CANT</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s name
with similar device or cross, etc.</p>


<h3>BALDRED, 805-823.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, bust or cross within inner circle, <span class="f90">BALDRED</span>, <span class="f90">BELDRED</span>,
or <span class="f90">BEALDRED REX CN</span> or <span class="f90">CANT</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s name,
cross, etc. One of his coins has on the <i>reverse</i> <span class="f90">DIORMOD
MONETA</span>, and within the inner circle, in two lines, <span class="f90">DRVR CITS</span>
for <i>Dorovernia Civitas</i> or city of Canterbury, and is the earliest
known instance of place of mintage appearing upon Saxon
coins.</p>


<h3><i>MERCIAN KINGS.</i> OFFA, 757-796.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i_021_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_021_small.jpg" width="300" height="234" alt="coins" /></a>
</div>

<p>The coins of Offa are of great variety in type, of considerable
beauty in design, and of better workmanship than most of the
Saxon pennies. On the <i>obverse</i> is the name <span class="f90">OFFA REX</span>, or <span class="f90">REX<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
M</span>, or <span class="f90">REX MERCIORN</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, various crosses and other
devices and moneyer’s name. Of these upwards of fifty are
known, and some of them used Runic letters.</p>


<h3>CYNEFRYTH.</h3>

<p>Coins of this queen (supposed to be the wife of Offa) are
known, and bear on one side the bust and moneyer’s name; on
the other her name and <span class="f90">REGINA</span>.</p>


<h3>COENVVLF, 794-818.</h3>

<p>The coins bear a marked resemblance to those of Offa, but
are inferior in execution. The name is usually <span class="f90">COENVVLF REX</span>,
with or without <span class="f90">M</span> for Mercia, and on the <i>reverse</i> the moneyer’s
name, and often the word <span class="f90">MONETA</span>. Upwards of fifty moneyers
are known.</p>


<h3>CEOLVVLF I., 819.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i_022_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_022_small.jpg" width="300" height="122" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p>The appropriation of coins to this king is conjectural.
The name occurs as <span class="f90">CIOLVVLF</span> or <span class="f90">CEOLVVLF REX M</span>, or <span class="f90">MI</span> or
<span class="f90">MCI</span> or <span class="f90">MERCI</span>.</p>


<h3>BEORNVVLF, 820-824.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, <span class="f90">BEORNVVLF</span> or <span class="f90">BEORNWVLF REX</span>, <span class="f90">REX M</span>, etc., with
bust. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s name.</p>


<h3>LUDICA or LUDICAN, 824, 825.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, <span class="f90">LVDICA REX</span> or <span class="f90">RX</span>, <span class="f90">ME</span> with bust. <i>Reverse</i>,
moneyer’s name, with cross, etc.</p>


<h3>WIGLAF, 825-839.</h3>


<p><i>Obverse</i>, <span class="f90">VVIGLAF REX M</span> and bust. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s
name, with cross.</p>

<h3>BERTHVVLF, 839-852.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, bust, and name <span class="f90">BERHTVLF</span> or <span class="f90">BERHTVVLF REX</span> or
<span class="f90">REX M</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s name, with cross, etc.; one has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
tall cross between <span class="f90">T A</span>, and another the Christian monogram
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="60" height="46" alt="CR" /> within the inner circle. About twenty moneyers are
known.</p>


<h3>BURGHRED, 852-874.</h3>

<p><i>Obverse</i>, bust, and name <span class="f90">BVRGRED</span> or <span class="f90">BVRGRD</span>; <span class="f90">RE</span>, <span class="f90">REX</span>, or
<span class="f90">RECX M</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s name, usually in a line across the
middle of the coin with <span class="f90">MON</span> above and <span class="f90">ETA</span> below. About one
hundred and fifty varieties of moneyers’ names are known.</p>


<h3>CEOLVVLF II., 874.</h3>

<p>The coins of this last of the Mercian kings are not very
satisfactorily to be distinguished from those of Ceolvvlf I. They
bear a bust and <span class="f90">CIOLVVLF</span> or <span class="f90">CEOLVVLF REX</span>.</p>


<h3><i>KINGS OF THE EAST ANGLES.</i> BEONNA.</h3>

<p>Beonna or Beorn was contemporary with Offa. <i>Obverse</i>,

<span class="f90">EDILARE</span>, etc.; <span class="f90">R</span>, <span class="f90">RE</span>, or <span class="f90">REX</span>, <span class="f90">A</span> or <span class="f90">AN</span>. <i>Reverse</i>, moneyer’s
name, of which several varieties are known.</p>


<h3><i>KINGS OF NORTHUMBERLAND.</i> ECGFRITH, 670-685.</h3>

<h3>EADBERHT, 737-758.</h3>

<p>Nothing can be definitely asserted as to the coins of this king;

<h3>MOLL ETHILWALD, 759-765.</h3>

<p>Two coins have been attributed to him, the name on the

struck somewhere between 905 and 941; and those of St. Martin
from 921 to 942.</p>

<p>The coins of William the Conqueror and his son William Rufus
cannot, with any degree of certainty, be distinguished the one from
the other; their appropriation is therefore purely conjectural.</p>

in dexter or sinister profile; on some the shoulders and arm extending
to the edge of the coin, on others the whole confined
within the inner circle; sometimes with tassel, or pendant, hanging
from the crown on either side (“bonnet” type), or with a canopy
over the head (“canopy” type). On one or both sides of the bust
is generally a sceptre, or star; or sceptre on one side and star on
the other; or sword. Those usually ascribed to the first William
are those with the sceptres only; the others are attributed to William
II. But this is entirely supposititious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Pennies only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Crowned bust, sometimes full-faced, at others
three-quarter faced, or in dexter or sinister profile; generally with a
sceptre in the right hand, sometimes one, two, or three stars, or a

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Pennies only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Crowned bust, sometimes almost full-faced,
but generally in dexter profile; sceptre, mace, lance, or flag in the

<p><span class="smcap">Reverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Crosses, etc., in great variety, all within the
inner circle; some have the space usually allotted to the legend
filled with various little devices, as roses, escallops, etc.; the
Stephen and Henry (or Matilda) is of this kind. One example,
struck at Derby, has within the inner circle a double cross, between
the limbs of which are four martlets.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> Mint master’s and town names, of which there are many
varieties.</p>

<p><i>Rarity.</i> All very rare. The Stephen and Henry (or Matilda) at
Tyssen’s sale, in 1802, brought ten guineas, and at Dimsdale’s, in
1824, thirteen pounds two shillings and sixpence, and later, much
higher prices.</p>

<p>Other coins bear the name of Eustace, son of Stephen (<span class="f90">EVSTACIVS</span>.

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Crowned bust, full-faced or profile; sceptre

<h3>RICHARD I. (1189 to 1199.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> The only coins known of this monarch are
those struck at Poictou and Aquitaine; they have no bust, merely a
plain cross patée. No English examples have as yet been discovered;
the Evesham ones, etc., were forged by White.</p>

<h3>JOHN. (1199 to 1216.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Pennies, Halfpennies, and Farthings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> No English coins of John are known, but
there are abundant proofs that coins were during his reign struck
to a considerable extent in England. The supposition, amounting
almost to a certainty, is that the “short cross” pennies of Henry II.
continued to be struck and issued during this reign as well as in the
early part of the next. The Irish coins of John have&mdash;<i>Penny</i>, full-faced,
crowned bust, within a triangle, sceptre in the right hand;
on the left of the head a rose. <i>Halfpenny</i> and <i>Farthing</i>, head in
triangle, on either side a star; one variety of halfpenny, called
the “full moon halfpenny,” has the face filling up the whole field
of the coin, the inner circle forming the outline of the face.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> <span class="f90">IOHAN.</span> or <span class="f90">IOHANNES</span>.&mdash;<span class="f90">REX</span> or <span class="f90">DOM.</span> or <span class="f90">DO.</span>&mdash;the
latter has <span class="f90">IOHANNES DOM.</span>; Farthing, <span class="f90">WILLEM ON.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> <i>Penny</i> and <i>Halfpenny</i>, within a triangle a
crescent, above which is a star or cross. Penny, a star at each
point and side of triangle; Halfpenny, star on either side the
crescent; Farthing, within a triangle a star; “full moon” halfpenny,
a voided cross between four annulets, within inner circle.</p>

<p><i>Legend</i>. Mint master’s and town names; as <span class="f90">ROBERD ON DIVE.</span>,
for Robert of Dublin; <span class="f90">WILLEM ON LI</span>, or <span class="f90">WILLEM ON LIME</span>,
for William of Limerick; or <span class="f90">WILLEM ON WA</span>, for William, of
Waterford. The Farthing has <span class="f90">IOHANNES</span> and <span class="f90">DW</span> (Dublin) in continuation
of obverse.</p>

<p><i>Rarity.</i> All very rare, the Farthing more particularly so.</p>


<h3>HENRY III. (1216 to 1272.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Gold</i>, Penny. <i>Silver</i>, Pennies only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> <i>Silver Penny.</i> Full face, crowned in some,
without neck or shoulders; on some, on the right of the head (in
the legend), a hand holding a sceptre over the head; in some, a
mullet or star, in others a crescent and mullet.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> <span class="f90">HERICVS.</span> or <span class="f90">HENRICVS</span>.&mdash;<span class="f90">REX.</span> or <span class="f90">REX ANG.</span>&mdash;<span class="f90">III.</span> <span class="f90">TER.</span>
or <span class="f90">TERCI.</span> The legends of these coins are remarkable for the letters
in many instances being conjoined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> There are two mintages. The early one (called
“short cross pennies”) has a voided cross within the inner circle,
and four pellets conjoined in each compartment; but the practice of
clipping and filing the moneys had been carried to such an extent,
that about 1248 Henry issued a new coinage, called “long cross
pennies,” with the same cross, but extending through to the outer
edge, thereby rendering any mutilation visible. The cross is a voided
or double one, each end terminating in a pellet, and one in the
centre; three pellets were now inserted in each compartment instead
of four, and not conjoined.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> Mint master’s and town names; some have <span class="f90">TER.</span> or
<span class="f90">TERCI.</span> added; as, <span class="f90">TER. RI ON LVND.</span> in continuation of obverse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
One variety reads <span class="f90">LIE TERCI LON</span>, being a continuation of <span class="f90">HENRICVS
REX ANG.</span> of the obverse; this, in full, would be “<span class="f90">HENRICVS REX
ANGLIE TERCI. LON</span>.”</p>

<p><i>Rarity.</i> Not uncommon; those with <span class="f90">TERCI.</span> and <span class="f90">REX ANG.</span> rare.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/i_038a_small.jpg" width="300" height="127" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>Gold.</i> The <i>Gold Penny</i> of Henry III. was the first gold coin
struck by any English monarch; it is therefore important as marking
a new era in numismatics. The weight is forty-five grains, and it is
of pure, unalloyed gold. On the <i>obverse</i> is a full length robed and
crowned figure of the king seated on a throne or chair of state, with
sceptre in right hand, and orb and cross in the left. Legend <span class="f90">HENRIC
REX III.</span> <i>Reverse</i>, a long double or voided cross and pellets, a rose
between the pellets in each compartment. This coin has fetched
at sales as much as £140.</p>

<p>From this time till Edward III., no other gold coins were struck
by English monarchs.</p>


<h3>EDWARD I. (1272 to 1307.)</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/i_038b_big.jpg">
<img src="images/i_038b_small.jpg" width="300" height="136" alt="coin" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Penny, Halfpenny, and Farthing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Crowned full-faced bust of the king, with
neck and part of the shoulders draped; crown, consisting of three
fleurs-de-lis, and two lozenges, balls, or points; beneath the rim of
the crown, on the forehead, is a row of from one to five pearls; the
hair, which is very abundant, stands out a considerable distance on
either side the face, and curled; the whole within the inner circle.
The Irish mintages are distinguished by having the head in a triangle,
the legend running on its three sides; there are one or two specimens
of English coins with the triangle, but they are very rare.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> <span class="f90">E. EDW.</span> [<span class="f90">EDWA. EDWAR. EDWARD. EDWARDVS.</span>]&mdash;<span class="f90">R.
REX.</span> or <span class="f90">D.G.R.</span>&mdash;<span class="f90">A. AN. ANG</span> or <span class="f90">ANGL.</span>&mdash;<span class="f90">D.H.</span> or <span class="f90">DNS HYB</span>. There
are many opinions respecting the Pennies of the first three Edwards.
The one most generally received is, that those with the name contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to <span class="f90">EDW.</span> belong to Edward I.; those with the name in full
<span class="f90">EDWARD</span>, to Edward III.; and the intermediate varieties to Edward
II. It remains still, however, a vexed question, and one not easy
of solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> A plain cross, with its terminations enlarged,
extending through to the outer edge of the coin and dividing the
legend into four parts; three pellets in each compartment within the
inner circle.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> In every instance except one, which has a moneyer’s
name, <span class="f90">ROBERTVS DE HADL.</span>, or <span class="f90">ROBERT DE HADELIE</span>, consists of
the name of the city or town where struck; as, <span class="f90">CIVITAS LONDON.</span>
<span class="f90">VILL BEREWICI.</span> <span class="f90">VILLA BRISTOLLIE.</span> <span class="f90">CIVITAS EBORACI.</span> <span class="f90">CIVITAS
CANTOR.</span> <span class="f90">CIVITAS DVREME.</span> <span class="f90">CIVITAS LINCOL.</span> <span class="f90">VILL SCI EDMVNDI.</span>
<span class="f90">CIVITAS CESTRIE.</span> <span class="f90">CIVITAS EXONIE.</span> <span class="f90">VIL NOVI CASTRI.</span> <span class="f90">VILL
KYNGESTON</span>, etc.</p>

<p><i>Rarity.</i> Pennies common, with the exception of a few mintages.
The Halfpenny and Farthing very rare, the Farthing particularly so.</p>


<h3>EDWARD II. (1307 to 1327.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Pennies, Halfpennies, and Farthings.</p>

<p>As I have just remarked, the coins bearing intermediate abbreviations
of the king’s name, between <span class="f90">EDW.</span> and <span class="f90">EDWARD</span>, are, more
for convenience than by right, appropriated to this monarch. The
description just given will therefore apply to the coins of this reign.</p>

as those of his predecessors. The Groat and Half-groat have the
bust within the circle of arches; Penny, Halfpenny, and Farthing,
the same as before. Some have the royal badge of the House of
York, the rose, on either side the neck of the bust, and others an

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> To this monarch we owe the great change
which has been, since his reign, gradually improving in coins. In
the first issue, his coins very closely resemble those of Henry VI.
Bust crowned with an open double-arched crown, now first used;
some have a key on either side the Bust. In the 18th year of his
reign his coins assumed a very different character. The circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
arches was discarded; the head (which, for the first time, may be
considered as a portrait) is represented in dexter profile, crowned
with a double or single arched crown, with the ball and cross on top.
The Penny of his later issue has the king sitting in a chair of state,
crowned, sceptre in his right, and globe in his left hand.</p>

others common. Second coinage, Shilling with <span class="f90">VII.</span>, Groat with

cross in his left, hand; reverse within a tressure of ten arches a large
double rose, in the centre of which is a shield bearing the arms of
France and England quarterly. In the space between the arches of

reverse a rose with royal shield in the centre as first described. Angel
and angelet much the same as those of his predecessors. Rial,
Double-sovereign, and Sovereign, rare; others, common.</p>

<h3>ELIZABETH. (1558 to 1603.)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Crown, Half-crown, Shilling, Sixpence,
Groat, Threepence, Half-groat, Three-halfpence, Penny,
Three-farthing, Halfpenny. <i>Gold.</i> Sovereign or Double-rial,
Rial, Pound-sovereign, Half-sovereign, Crown, Half-crown, Angel,
Angelet, Quarter-angel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Silver. Crown and Half-crown, sinister bust
profile, crowned, open double-arched crown, hair turned back,
draped, robe with wide puffed sleeves, stiff frill round the neck; in
the right hand the sceptre, the orb as if held in the left. The Shilling,
Sixpence, Groat, Threepence, Half-groat, Three-halfpence, Penny,
Three-farthing, Halfpenny, and Farthing have also the bust profile,
crowned with a single-arched crown, hair long and flowing down the
back, draped robe, much plainer than before, and having no sceptre
or orb.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Sixpence, Threepence, Three-halfpence, and Three-farthing
pieces are distinguished from the others by having the
Tudor rose behind the head. It was in reference to this distinguishing
mark of a rose behind the head that the satirist on costumes
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">“... Behind her head a rose<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That people cry, ‘Lo! there Three-farthings goes!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The commonest Halfpenny has a portcullis instead of the bust; the
one with the bust is extremely rare. The “milled” money is neater
in execution than the earlier “hammered” pieces. The “portcullis”
money, struck in 1601 for foreign use, has on the obverse the royal
arms, surmounted by a crown, between the initials E. and R., each
crowned, and the usual name and titles of the queen; reverse, a
portcullis crowned, and the <span class="f90">POSVI</span>, etc., legend.</p>

France, and the Great Province captured under her auspices”).</p>


<p>In this reign pattern copper coins were struck, but never issued.
The Penny bore on the obverse a full-face portrait of the queen,
and the words <span class="f90">THE PLEDGE OF</span>; and on the reverse the crowned
monogram, and the continuation of the legend, <span class="smcap">A PENNY</span>, and date
1601. Other pattern pieces were also struck of copper, lead, pewter,

<h3>CHARLES I. (1625 to 1649).</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Denominations.</span>&mdash;<i>Silver.</i> Twenty-shilling-piece or Pound,
Ten-shilling-piece or Half-pound, Crown, Half-crown, Shilling,
Sixpence, Groat, Threepence, Half-groat, Penny, and Halfpenny.</p>

<p><i>Gold.</i> Tower Mint. Unit, Broad, or Twenty-shilling-piece;
Double-crown or Half-broad or Ten-shilling-piece; crown, Britain-crown,
or Five-shilling-piece, Angel. Oxford Mint, Treble-Unit, or

Double-crown, or Ten-shilling-piece. Briot’s Mint. Unit, Double-crown,
or Half Unit, Angel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Twenty-shilling and Ten-shilling-piece, king
on horseback with or without artillery, armour, arms, etc., under
horse’s feet. Crowns and Half-crowns, king in armour on horseback,
but with very many variations in detail. One description is as much
as our limits will allow. The Oxford Crown, the rarest in the series,
has the king on horseback, in armour, to the left, crowned, double-arched
crown, drawn sword in his right hand, a sash round his neck,
coming under his left arm, the ends flying behind; the horse not
caparisoned, having only a saddle cloth. On the field of the coin,
beneath the horse, is a view of the city of Oxford, with the word
<span class="f90">OXON</span> above it. This coin is beautifully executed. Shilling, Half-shilling,
Quarter-shilling, Groat, Half-groat, and Penny, sinister bust
profile, in robes, crowned, hair long and flowing, beard long. Some
Groats and Half-groats have a rose crowned as also have Pennies.
Halfpenny, a rose, no legend, or a rose crowned between <span class="f90">C. R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></span>
The variations in the coins, consequent on the number of mints
set up&mdash;London, Exeter, Aberystwith, Oxford, Bristol, Chester,
Worcester, Weymouth, York, and other places&mdash;is very great; the
differences being more or less important both as to mint marks and
other features.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> <span class="f90">C.</span> <span class="f90">CAR.</span> or <span class="f90">CAROLVS</span>. <span class="f90">D. G. MAGNA BRITAN. FRAN. ET
HIBER. REX</span>, variously abbreviated. Oxford Crown, <span class="f90">CAROLVS. D. G.
MAG. BRIT. FRAN. ET. HIBER. REX.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Generally the royal shield. The Oxford Crown
and some other coins have no device, except an ornament to divide
the legends; and the Prince of Wales’ feathers three times repeated,
or single, above. On some, the shield (which is as James I.’s) is oval,
and mantled, sometimes crowned; others have shields, the quarterings
terminating in a cross moline, etc. The smaller coins have
sometimes a rose crowned, sceptres, or sceptre and trident in saltire,
etc., or the declaration <span class="f90">EXVRGAT</span>, etc., in lines across. One
Half-groat has two Cs interlinked, crowned.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> Oxford Crown, <span class="f90">EXVRGAT DEVS DISSIPENTVR INIMICI</span>.
In the field of the coin, in two parallel lines, is <span class="f90">RELIG. PROT. LEG.
ANG. LIBER. PARL.</span>, beneath which is 1644, <span class="f90">OXON</span>, and above v. for
value. A branch of leaves and flowers between the words of the
first. Others have <span class="f90">CHRISTO AVSPICE REGNO</span>. Others <span class="f90">IVSTITIA
THRONVM FIRMAT</span>, or <span class="f90">TVEATVR VNITA DEVS</span>. The groat has
<span class="f90">RELIG.</span>, etc., within a scroll on the field, <span class="f90">EXURGAT</span>, etc.</p>

<p><i>Rarity.</i> For the most part common. The Oxford crown is of
the most extreme rarity, and most of the Oxford mintages are rare,
as are those of Aberystwith and other places.</p>

<p><i>Gold.</i> Three-pound-piece, crowned profile bust to the waist, with
or without sword and olive branch; feathers behind the head; reverse,
declaration in three lines. Unit or Broad-piece, bust profile,
crowned, much varied on some with drawn sword and olive branch;
behind the head <span class="f90">XX</span> for value. Reverse: On field, <span class="f90">RELIG.</span>, etc.,
on a ribband. Double-crown and Crown, bust profile crowned.
Reverse. Shield crowned, <span class="f90">CVLTORES. SVI. DEVS. PROTEGIT</span>. Angel
same type as its predecessors.</p>

<p><i>Copper.</i>&mdash;Halfpence and Farthings, David playing the harp, looking
upward; above, a crown, <span class="f90">FLOREAT REX</span>. Reverse: Halfpenny,
St. Patrick in full robes, mitered, with crosier, etc., holding to figures
around him the shamrock leaf; behind him the arms of Dublin.
Farthing, St. Patrick as before, stretching his hand over reptiles;
behind him a cathedral; legend, <span class="f90">QVIESCAT PLEBS</span>. Other Halfpence,
Farthings and Half-farthings have on obverse two sceptres in saltire,
behind, a crown, or <span class="f90">C. R.</span> crowned. Reverse: Some, the royal rose
crowned; others, the Irish harp crowned; and others, again, the
Scotch thistle; others, a small pellet of brass inserted in the centre
of the rose. <i>Legend.</i> Obverse: <span class="f90">CAR.</span> <span class="f90">CARO.</span> or <span class="f90">CAROLVS</span>.&mdash;<span class="f90">D. G.
MAG. BRIT.</span> Reverse: On some, the Scotch motto, <span class="f90">NEMO.</span>, etc.;
others, continuation of titles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obsidional</span> or <span class="smcap">Siege Pieces</span>. These rude coins, if coins they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
can be called, were struck by the king, and those favourable to his
cause, to supply that monarch with the necessary funds for carrying
on his wars. They are extremely interesting, as showing the various
inconveniences and shifts the king was subject to. The nobility and
gentry, his partisans, were applied to for the use of all their plate,
as were also wardens and fellows of the different colleges in the
universities of Oxford, etc., the mayors and corporations, of cities
and towns, etc. The plate thus collected was chopped up, for the
greatest part, in unmeaning shapes, and struck or engraved with
different devices, and the value. The Scarborough Half-crown is a
piece of thin plate doubled, the corners turned over to hold together.
On one side is engraven in a very rude manner the castle, with the
value in numerals; and on the other, <span class="f90">OBS. SCARBOROUGH</span>, 1645.
The Newark Shilling, which is one of the commonest, is lozenge
shaped. Obverse, crown between <span class="f90">C. R.</span>; beneath, <span class="f90">XII</span>. Reverse,
<span class="f90">OBS. NEWARK</span>, 1646. Pontefract, sometimes an octagonal, and
sometimes a round piece. Obverse, <span class="f90">C. R.</span> under a crown; <span class="f90">DVM
SPIRO SPERO</span>. Reverse, Pontefract Castle, with name or letters.
Other places where these were struck were Colchester, Carlisle,
Dublin, Cork, etc. At Colchester a gold siege piece of the value of
10s. was struck. A history of the coinage in this reign alone would
fill a folio volume.</p>

<p>I may here mention a most splendid specimen of the die-sinker’s
art, produced by Simon, the celebrated die-sinker, as a trial piece
against an artist who was employed by Charles. The obverse has
a bust of the king of most exquisite workmanship, and round the
<i>edge</i> of the coin, in place of <span class="f90">DECVS.</span>, etc., was this simple petition in
two lines: “<span class="f90">THOMAS. SIMON.</span> most humbly prays your <span class="f90">MAJESTY</span> to
compare this, his tryal piece, with the Dutch, and, if more truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
drawn, and embossed, more gracefully ordered, and more accurately
engraven, to relieve him.” At Trattle’s sale, in 1832, a
very fine specimen sold for £225. It is said that only twenty copies
were struck with the petition on the edge, and a few others with a
different edge, <span class="f90">REDDITE QVAE CAESARES CAESARI</span> &amp; <span class="f90">POST</span>; and
one is recorded to be known bearing, <span class="f90">RENDER TO CÆSAR THE

<p><i>Gun Money.</i> Silver being scarce in this reign, an issue of base
money was resorted to, some of which, being struck from the old
cannon and domestic utensils melted down, is called “Gun Money.”
The Crown, which is scarce, has the king in armour, laureated, on
horseback, with a drawn sword, a long sash flying behind; reverse,
four shields in cross, with the crown in the centre; the Half-crowns,
Shillings, and Sixpences have two sceptres in saltire, behind a
crown, between I. R.; above the crown are numerals for value, and
beneath, the month in which it was struck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>

crowned. Half-farthings: obverse, sceptres in saltire, and crown;
reverse, harp or rose, crowned. There is also a kind called plug-money;
this was struck owing to a scarcity of copper; it is of
pewter, and in the middle is inserted a very small square plug of
copper, to show that it is intended to pass for copper money. One
tin Halfpenny has the king on horseback with drawn sword, on the
obverse, and on the reverse the harp surmounted by a crown with
lion crest, and two sceptres in saltire; in this two or more plugs
of brass are inserted. Other varieties need not be particularized.
White metal coins were also issued.</p>

the centre, the shield of Nassau; between the shields, <span class="f90">W.</span> and <span class="f90">M.</span>

monograph. Some Half-crowns have a plain shield of the royal
arms, crowned; Fourpence, Threepence, Twopence, and Penny,
values crowned. After the death of Mary, feathers on some, and
on others roses, take the place of the monogram of <span class="f90">W</span> and <span class="f90">M</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverse.</span>&mdash;<i>Type.</i> Four crowned shields in cross. Before the

After the union they were altered to two shields of England

centre, the cross of St. George, in a star of the garter; between
the shields, feathers or roses, or feathers and roses alternately;
Fourpence, Threepence, Twopence, and Penny, values, crowned.</p>

<p><i>Legend.</i> <span class="f90">MAG BRI FR ET HIB REG</span> and date.</p>

<p><i>Edge.</i> <span class="f90">DECVS ET TVTAMEN</span>, and year of reign.</p>

<p><i>Rarity.</i> All common. The smaller denominations scarcer than
the others.</p>

<p><i>Gold.</i> Same type and legend and edge. Reverse, sceptres
between the shields.</p>

<p><i>Copper.</i> As there is so much popular error concerning the
farthings, it may be well to remark at length upon them, in order
to clear away the absurd idea generally entertained, of there being
only three in existence. Instead of this being the case, there are
absolutely six distinct varieties. The first, which is the only one
which was ever in general circulation, has, on the obverse, sinister
bust profile, of queen, draped, hair thrown back, encircled with a
string of pearls, <span class="f90">ANNA DEI GRATIA</span>; reverse, figure of Britannia,
olive branch in her right, and spear in her left hand, <span class="f90">BRITANNIA</span>,
date, 1714, in exergue: this, although scarce, is by far the commonest
of the whole: there is one with the same type, but broad
rim, which is rare. Second, bust as before, <span class="f90">ANNA REGINA</span>; reverse,
as last. Third, same bust, <span class="f90">ANNA DEI GRATIA</span>; reverse,
figure of Britannia, right leg bare; <span class="f90">BRITANNIA</span>, 1713, round.
Fourth, obverse as before; reverse, Britannia, as last, under an
arch; <span class="f90">BRITANNIA</span> in exergue, 1713. Fifth, bust as before, with band
instead of pearls, within an inner circle (the busts on the others are
on the field); reverse, figure of Britannia standing, helmeted, in
the right hand the olive branch, and in her left the spear, within
inner circle; <span class="f90">BELLO ET PACE</span>; date 1715, in exergue. Sixth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
bust as one, <span class="f90">ANNA AVGVSTA</span>; reverse, same figure as last, standing
in a car, drawn by two horses; in her right hand she holds the olive
branch, in her left the reins and a spear; <span class="f90">PAX MISSA PER ORBEM</span>;
in exergue, 1713. The prices depend upon the state of preservation
of the coins, but, for <span class="f90">FINE</span> ones, the following are about the values:
1, from six shillings to fourteen shillings; 2 and 3, from fifteen
shillings to thirty shillings; 3, 4, and 6, from two to three pounds:
5, the rarest, from five to ten, or twelve pounds. There is a small
medal, or counter, which is very frequently mistaken by the generality
of persons for one of her farthings. It has on the obverse
the bust, with <span class="f90">ANNA DEI GRATIA</span>; reverse, the four shields in cross,
sometimes plain, and sometimes with roses between the shields,
<span class="f90">MAG BR FRA ET HIB REG</span> 1711; frequently <span class="f90">RIG</span> instead of <span class="f90">REG</span>.
Some of these are of beautiful workmanship, and others very
rude: they are far from being scarce; they were not struck as
current coins. Halfpenny, bust, <span class="f90">ANNA D G MAG BR FR ET HIB
REG</span>; reverse, sitting figure of Britannia, leaning on a shield, in her
left hand a spear, in her right a rose and thistle emanating from
the same branch; the whole beneath a crown.</p>

<p>During great scarcity of silver money in 1797 Spanish dollars
and half-dollars were countermarked with a small punch of the
king’s head and put into circulation as current coin of the value of
4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> This stamp having been counterfeited to a considerable
extent, a different one was adopted in 1804, but it in turn being
much counterfeited, the whole dollar was re-stamped with a fresh
octagonal device, the king’s head, etc., on the obverse, and on the
reverse a figure of Britannia within an oval, crowned with a mural
crown, and having the words <span class="f90">BANK OF ENGLAND FIVE SHILLINGS

<p class="ph2">TRADERS’ TOKENS.</p>


<p>The Traders’ Tokens of this kingdom, properly so-called, are
confined, in issue, to the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early part
of the nineteenth centuries&mdash;those of the first of these periods
being the most numerous as well as, in most respects, the most
interesting. Though not coins in the ordinary sense, not having
been issued by kings or governments, they play a more important
part in the history of the country than even the regal pieces
do, and the information to be derived from their study is not only
valuable but in many instances entertaining.</p>

<p>Coins, the currency of nations, as I have, on another occasion,
observed, are hoarded up and studied, and constantly referred to
in illustration of historical facts, or as corroborations in cases of
doubtful points; and their value, admitted on all hands, cannot
be too highly estimated. They, however, tell but of princes and
nationalities, not of the people. The coins of Greece and Rome
tell of events, of changes, and of wars, and become, when properly
studied, a complete epitome of the history of the great nations
to which they belong. Those of our own country, however, have
not that recommendation&mdash;they become simply, and solely, matters
of regal chronology. From the Norman Conquest to the present
hour not one event does an English coin record, not one national
trait does it exhibit, and not one matter connected with national
history or the people does it illustrate.</p>

<p>Not so with Traders’ Tokens. Issued <i>by</i> the people, they tell
<i>of</i> the people, and become imperishable records of that most important
estate of the realm. They indicate to us their occupations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and their skill; their customs and their modes of life; their local
governments; their guilds and trade companies; their habits and
sentiments; their trades, their costume, their towns, their families,
and their homes. Pity it is that these lasting and reliable records
and adjuncts to national history are, as I have just said, confined
to some two centuries of our historical annals&mdash;but of those two
periods (and especially of the earliest) they are, assuredly, among
the more interesting and important of illustrations.</p>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon and mediæval times the want of small coins&mdash;that
is, a currency representing a small value&mdash;was much felt, and
this gave rise to the occasional issue of spurious, or rather base,
coins to supply the deficiency, as it was found the smaller pieces&mdash;for
instance, the pennies when broken up for use as halfpence
and farthings&mdash;were unfit for general use among the rough-handed
population.</p>

<p>In the reigns of Edward VI. and Mary the issue of a base-metal
currency gave rise to considerable dissatisfaction and
fraud, and under Elizabeth, who issued three-halfpence and
three-farthing pieces, that spurious currency was declared no
longer current. Despite the issuing, however, of these three-halfpenny
and three-farthing pieces, the want of halfpennies
and farthings was still so seriously felt by the entire population,
that housekeepers, chandlers, grocers, mercers, vintners, and most
other traders were impelled, for conscience' sake, to the issue of
private tokens of lead, pewter, latten, tin, and even leather, for
the purposes of trade. These were issued by the traders, and
commodities in exchange could only be had from their issuers;
they were thus useless as a circulating medium and a source of
frequent loss to their holders.</p>

<p>In 1574 a proposition was made to the Queen by two persons
named Wickliffe and Humphrey, to coin halfpence and
farthings in base silver (to weigh respectively 12 and 6 grains),
but was not acted upon. It was then proposed to coin pledges
of copper, and a proclamation forbidding the use of private
tokens and authorizing those just named was prepared; this,
however, again, was not acted upon, and private tokens still continued
in use. In 1582 the three-farthing pieces were withdrawn
and silver halfpennies issued. They bear on the obverse a portcullis
and mint mark, and on the reverse a cross and pellets.</p>

<p>In 1601 and 1602 the requirements of the army in Ireland
caused, for a time, the issue of copper pence, halfpence, and
farthings, and this seems to have revived the idea of copper
pledges for England, for which, indeed, pattern pieces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
struck. Copper tokens were, at that time, issued by the cities
of Oxford, Worcester, and Bristol.</p>

<p>On the accession of James I. that monarch issued silver pennies
for this country, in which his Scottish baubees, bodles, and placks
were useless. A pattern farthing was also prepared but not
issued. Soon afterwards a fresh scheme, which met the approval
of the king, was acted upon. This was the issue of Royal
farthing tokens weighing only six grains each. The licence to
mint these dishonest coins which, for the purpose of getting them
into circulation, were sold by the Crown to all comers at 21
shillings’ worth for a pound, was granted to Lord Harrington&mdash;the
king stipulating that he should receive one-half the profit every
quarter of a year. His majesty, however, ere long altered the
arrangement, allowing Lord Harrington a fixed sum, and himself
taking all the rest of the profit. Their principal distributor was
Gerard Malyns, who thus spoke of their intention and use:&mdash;“The
necessitye of these small moneys did appeare here with us
in England, where everie chandler, tapster, vintner, and others,
made tokens of lead and brasse for half-pences, and at Bristol
by the late Queenes authoritie were made of copper, with a ship
on one side, and C.B. on the other side, signifying <span class="smcap">Civitas
Bristoll</span>: these went current, for small things, at Bristoll and
ten miles about. Hereupon, it pleased our soveraigne lord the
king to approve of the making of a competent quantitie of farthing
tokens to abolish the said leaden tokens, made in derogation of
the king’s prerogative royall, which farthing tokens, being in
the yeare 1613, with certain cautions and limitations, made of
meere copper, have on the one side two sceptres crossing under
one diadem, in remembrance of the union betweene England and
Scotland; and on the other side the harpe for Ireland, and the
inscription, ‘<span class="f90">IACOBVS D.G. MAGNÆ. BRITT. FRA. ET HIBER.
REX</span>.’ And the said farthing tokens have not oneley beene
found very commodius and necessarie for pettie commutations,
but also to be a great reliefe of the poore, and meanes to encrease
charitie, without which many of them had perished, everie man
having meanes to give almes, even the mechanicall poore to the
indigent poore.”</p>

<p>The mode adopted for distributing these farthing tokens and
getting them into circulation was crafty and business-like. They
were made up in packets of 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> worth in each, and these
packets, made up in bags of £20 worth in each, were sent to
the mayors of the different towns of the kingdom, who were
required to sell them to the public. For all sold and remitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for within two months the mayor was allowed two shillings in the
pound for his trouble; if over two months, then only one shilling;
and the purchaser of course in any case got 21<i>s.</i> worth for
20<i>s.</i> Thus each 21<i>s.</i> worth was sold by the king for 18<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Despite all this, however, and the issuing of proclamation
after proclamation to enforce this Royal swindle, private tokens
continued to be issued as much as ever and could not be put
down. The office for the issue of the Royal tokens was in
Lothbury, London, and the place is still known as “Token-House
Yard.” After the annulling of this office, copper farthing
tokens of a more honest value were issued, but traders still
struck their own to such an extent that they became more than
ever general throughout the country.</p>

<p>In 1649 an attempt was made to establish a national farthing,
and pattern pieces were prepared. Nothing, however, was done
until 1671, when Traders’ Tokens having increased to a prodigious
extent, and being issued by one or other in almost every town
and village in the kingdom, the government announced the intended
issue of halfpence and farthings to supersede them; and
in 1672 a proclamation prohibiting the making or use of any
such private tokens was issued, and stringent measures taken for
their suppression. From that time their use rapidly declined,
and they were soon utterly put down.</p>

<p>From that time (1672) until 1787 no Traders’ Tokens whatever
were struck or issued in this kingdom. In the latter year (1787)
the government having for a long time neglected to issue a sufficient
quantity of copper coins for the purposes of trade, and the
copper coinage having been forged to so great an extent that
not one-fourth of what was in circulation was of Royal mint
coining, the Anglesey Copper Mines Company issued tokens of
their own, and to such an extent that they put into circulation
three hundred tons of copper pennies and halfpennies. The
example thus set was followed by other companies, corporations,
and private traders, and tokens soon became so general that the
matter attracted the attention of government, and resulted in
orders being issued for the preparation of a new national coinage.</p>

<p>To that end in June, 1797, George the Third issued his warrant
empowering Matthew Boulton, of the Soho Works, Birmingham,
to manufacture a considerable quantity of penny and twopenny
pieces. The extent to which this contract was carried may be
gathered from the fact that between June, 1797, and 1805, Matthew
Boulton “coined under contract for the British Government
upwards of 4,000 tons weight of copper coin, amounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at its nominal value to nearly £800,000.” These coins were
strictly and unequivocally <i>honest</i>, as were also those of the Anglesey
and other works.</p>

<p>The Soho twopenny pieces weighed exactly two ounces each,
and eight of them laid side by side measured one foot; the
pennies weighed one ounce each, and seventeen in like manner
measured two feet; the halfpennies weighed half an ounce
each, and twelve of them measured one foot.</p>

<p>The effect of this issue was the stoppage of private tokens,
only one or two examples being known of so late a date as 1802,
when they finally ceased.</p>

<p>By 1811, consequent on the great increase in the value of
copper caused by the costly wars in which this country was engaged,
the twopenny and penny pieces (which were of the
intrinsic value of the metal) were melted down, or used in various
ways, and thus the copper currency had again, gradually and
surely, become deficient. In that year the Copper Companies
and others again resorted to the issue of batches of tokens, and
these continued to increase and to be issued in large numbers until
1817, when, by Act of Parliament passed on the 27th of July,
their manufacture was prohibited, and their issuers ordered, under
penalties for disobedience, to take up all they had issued before
the 1st of January, 1818.</p>

<p>Thus came entirely to an end the issue of Traders’ Tokens in
this country.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ascertain, or even to form a correct estimate
of, the number of varieties of seventeenth century tokens that were
issued. Boyne, after mature consideration and much research,
estimated the entire issue as not having exceeded 20,000, and in
that he was probably tolerably correct.</p>

<p>In round numbers the <i>known</i> examples of tokens of the seventeenth
century, issued in the various counties of England, Wales,
and Ireland, may be put down as in:&mdash;</p>

<p>Making a grand total in all of about twelve thousand distinct
varieties; and these, of course, can be only about one-half of
what were actually issued.</p>

<p>The denominations are Pennies, Half-pennies, and Farthings,
and they are of copper, or, in not a few instances, brass.</p>

<p>Their shape is usually round, but some are square, others
octagonal, others lozenge, and others again heart-shaped. These
varieties will be best understood by reference to the following
engravings, which may be taken as general typical examples.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p>They are usually thin, not very cleverly struck, and many of
them exhibit, in their orthography, ignorant and eccentric modes
of spelling names, both of persons, trades, and places. The
greater bulk of them are, fortunately, dated; the dates ranging
from about 1648 to 1672.</p>

<p>The inscriptions in by far the greatest number of examples
commence on the obverse, and are continued on the reverse.
They commonly consist of the christian and surname of the
issuer, his trade or occupation, and the town or village in which
he resided. Usually on the ordinary disc-formed tokens this
inscription is between the outer and inner circle of dotted lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
On the field, within the inner circle, is usually the value of the
coin; the initials of the issuer and his wife joined together with
a knot; trade-company, town, or family-arms; tavern or shop
sign; device, indicating the handicraft or trade of the issuer;
initials or other lettering; or other matter. On some, principally
on the square, lozenge, octagonal, and heart-shaped examples,
the inscription is placed in several lines across the entire
field, and is accompanied more or less by devices, etc.</p>

<p>Among devices the arms of Trade-guilds or Companies are
most numerous, and a brief description of those most commonly
met with will be found of great service to the collector. They
are as follows,&mdash;but for the sake of brevity, and as they are but
seldom indicated on the tokens themselves, I omit tinctures:&mdash;</p>

goats’ heads erased and attired. It is not unusual for the three
goats’ heads to be used without shield or chevron, and sometimes
a single goat’s head is introduced. The public-house sign of the

took its origin from these arms.</p>

<p>Arms of cities and towns are found not only on those tokens
which were issued by corporations, mayors, or other bodies or
officials, but by some tradesmen. Of the first an example or two
will be sufficient:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Obv.</i> <span class="f90">THE MAYOR OF</span> = A shield bearing the arms of the city

<p>Merchants marks, some of which are curious and of considerable
interest, were to some extent used. They were, indeed, of much
the same use as the “Trade Marks” of our own day. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
devices are implements of one kind or other connected with the
trade or calling of the issuer; articles of clothing made or sold
by him; animals and heraldic figures usually derived from guild
arms or from signs; articles of domestic use of endless variety;
and ships, boats, coaches, carriages, pack-horses, and numerous
other matters connected with the daily life of the people.</p>

<p>Rebusses and allusive designs&mdash;that is, devices containing a
play upon the name of the issuer&mdash;are far from uncommon. Thus
James Bolton, of Blackburn, adopted on each side his tokens the
device of a <i>bolt</i> and <i>tun</i>; Thomas Towers, of March, a <i>tower</i>;
Anthony Rachell, of Wisbech, a “<i>rachalled</i>” or cogged <i>wheel</i>;
Walter Coates, of Stockport, a <i>colt</i>; Francis Woodward, of
Crutched Friars, a <i>wood-ward</i> mounted and blowing his horn;
William Archer, of Deptford, an <i>archer</i> with bow and arrow;
Hannah Bell, of Tooley Street, a <i>bell</i>; Hugh Conny, of Potton,
three <i>conies</i>; John Curtis, of Yarmouth, two men <i>curtseying</i>;
Robert Hancock, of Whitefriars, a <i>hand</i> and a <i>cock</i>; Ralph
Harbottle, of Great Torrington, a <i>hare</i> and a <i>bottle</i>; Robert
Thornhill, who kept the “Bull” inn, a <i>Bull</i> standing under a
<i>Thorn</i> tree on a mound or <i>hill</i>; and so on.</p>

</div>

<p>Very frequently, and sometimes on the obverse and at others
on the reverse, are the initials of the issuer or, more frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
still, those of the issuer and his wife tied together with, or having
between them, a “true lover’s knot,” with floral or tasselled
terminations. The initials in the latter case are thus arranged<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.4em;">M</span><br />
I·K, that of the family name (Malyn) at the top, and those of
the Christian name, of the husband (John) and wife (Katherine),
at the sides as here engraved from a Duffield token.</p>

</div>

<p>On some the issuer has, as will occasionally be met with by
the collector, introduced some remarkably quaint inscriptions.
Thus on a token of Richard Bakewell, of Derby, 1666, is the
curious inscription, <span class="f90">GOOD MORROW VALENTINE</span>, the device
being two doves billing. On another Derby token, that of
William Newcome, we have on the obverse, <span class="f90">TOVCH NOT MINE
ANOINTED</span>, and on the reverse <span class="f90">DOE MY PROPHETS NOE HARME</span>.
On one of Samuel Hendon, of Macclesfield,</p>

<p class="center f90">WELCOME YOU BE<br />
TO TRADE WITH ME.
</p>

<p>On one of Thomas Cotton, of Middlewich,</p>

<p class="center f90">ALTHOVGH BVT BRASS<br />
YET LET ME PASS.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>On one of Ann Greene, of Skipton, <span class="f90">I WILL EXCHAING MY
PENY</span>. Others refer to the use and benefit of tokens alike to
the poor and to the traders. Thus on one of Andover, on one
side we have, <span class="f90">FOR YE POORE’S BENEFIT</span>, and on the other,
<span class="f90">HELP O’ ANDEVER, 1666</span>; on one of Winchcombe, <span class="f90">REMEMBER
THE POORE</span>; on one of Croyland, <span class="f90">THE POORE’S HALFE PENY
OF CROYLAND, 1670</span>; Great Yarmouth, <span class="f90">FOR THE VSE OF THE
POORE</span>; Chard, <span class="f90">THE BVRROVGH OF CHARD MADE BY YE
PORTREEVE FOR YE POORE</span>; Southwold, <span class="f90">FOR THE POORES
ADVANTAG</span>; Tamworth, <span class="f90">FOR CHANGE AND CHARITIE</span>; Worcester,
<span class="f90">FOR NECESSARIE CHAING</span>; and so on in very great
variety. They were often issued by the Mayor, the Portreeve,
the Overseers, the Chamberlain, or other official for public
convenience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The best, indeed only worthy, book on the general subject of
seventeenth century tokens is Boyne’s, published in 1858, in
which close upon ten thousand examples are carefully and
minutely described.</p>

<p>Of the more modern tokens&mdash;those so abundantly issued
during the thirty years preceding 1818&mdash;and of the silver tokens
of the latter part of that period which, including the Bank
Tokens, number some four hundred varieties, I purposely abstain
in this little work from giving any particulars.</p>

<p>Of those of silver and gold, Boyne’s “Silver Tokens of Great
Britain and Ireland,” etc., published in 1866, is the best and
most comprehensive list that has been prepared. Of those of
copper, Batty’s “Descriptive Catalogue,” in which some twenty
thousand varieties are minutely described, is as exhaustive a list
as could well be prepared.</p>

<h3>§ THE SCIENCE OF NUMISMATICS.</h3>

<p>The science of Numismatics (from the Greek word νὁμυὁμα, a
legally current coin) embraces the study of the coins of all the
nations of the earth who have at any period impressed upon
pieces of metal&mdash;gold, silver, bronze, brass, copper, iron, tin,
lead, etc. etc.&mdash;any devices (<i>types</i>), or inscriptions, indicating
that such pieces of metal were issued by authority for public use
as money.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the term Numismatics should not therefore
be applied to the study of medallions, medals, or counters,
whether commemorative, purely artistic, military, scholastic,
etc., unless, as is sometimes the case, such medals have been at
the same time current as money.</p>

<p>The study of medals is, however, in many respects so nearly
allied to Numismatics that it may be and frequently is included
in it for convenience sake.</p>

<p>For practical purposes coins may be roughly classified under
four principal headings:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" summary="Numismatics, coin classifications">
<tr><td class="tdl vm">I.</td>
    <td class="tdl vm">Ancient,</td>
    <td class="tdl vm">including</td>
    <td class="tdl">{ Greek, etc.<br />
                    { Roman, etc.<br />
                    { Phœnician, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">II.</td>
    <td class="tdl" colspan="3">Byzantine.</td></tr>

    <td class="tdl">{ European various.<br />
                    { Oriental various.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">IV.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Modern</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdl"> &nbsp; &nbsp; All countries.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Each series may be again subdivided into an enormous number
of classes, as will be seen when we come to examine the Greek
and Roman series to which the following pages will be devoted.</p>

<p>In the outset a few brief remarks on the uses of a cabinet of
antique coins may not be out of place. Of these the first and
foremost is the undoubted fact that these “strange face to face
vestiges of vanished æons” (to use an expression of Carlyle’s)
bring our minds into immediate contact with the life and history
of antiquity as no mere book-study can ever do. Not that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
would depreciate the value of a knowledge of history; on the
contrary, this is the one study which is all important for a
collector of coins. Without it a man may indeed become
familiar with the look of ancient coins, and he may gain much
practical knowledge of the prices which they usually fetch at
sales, but he will never be a true Numismatist. If he possess
the artistic sense he may admire them as works of art, but beyond
this they will be to him as a sealed book.</p>

<h2><a name="I_GREEK_COINS" id="I_GREEK_COINS"></a>I. GREEK COINS.</h2>


<h3>§ INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h3>

<p>The following extract from the preface to the British Museum
“Guide to the Coins of the Ancients”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> will give some idea of
the uses of Greek Numismatics.</p>

<p>“The chief value of Greek coins lies in their being original
works of art, not copies as are most of the extant sculptures in
the round, and in their recording the successive phases and local
varieties of Greek art, in which respect no other class of monuments,
sculptures, bronzes, terracottas, fictile vases, or gems, can
compete with them. From the seventh century before the
Christian era downwards, and from the farthest east to the extreme
west of the ancient civilized world, coins are still extant,
in many cases as uninjured as when they first left the dies. The
devices or <i>types</i> which they bear, if not by leading artists,
certainly faithfully represent the style of the sculpture and even
of the painting of the periods to which they belong. Thus in
no other branch of Greek monuments can the student so readily
and so thoroughly trace the growth, the maturity, and the decay
of the plastic art as on coins chronologically arranged.</p>

<p>“For the study of mythology they present the local conceptions
of the gods and heroes worshipped in the Greek world,
with their attributes and symbols.</p>

<p>“The historian will find a gallery of portraits of sovereigns
almost complete, as well as evidences of the history and of the
political revolutions of innumerable autonomous states and cities
in these all but imperishable records.</p>

<p>“The student of palæography will find on coins examples of
various ancient alphabets, such as Lycian and Cyprian, Phœnician,
Greek, Latin, Iberian, etc., in various stages of development.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“The metrologist, by comparing the weights of coins of different
localities and periods, may gain an insight into the various
systems of ancient metrology in its various standards, and obtain
a just view of the relative values of the precious metals, and of
the great lines of trade in the Greek and Roman world. For
practical purposes the medallist and art workman will find in
Greek coins the most profitable as well as the safest guide. The
artist will not fail to perceive the suggestive value of designs
which, on however small a scale, are essentially large in treatment.”</p>

<p>No one whose means are at all limited should attempt to form
a complete collection of Greek coins. Even the vast collection
in the British Museum is far from perfect, and in many series is
still lamentably deficient.</p>

<p>Any one, however, by limiting his ambition to one particular
branch, may hope in course of time to form a cabinet the value
of which will increase rapidly in proportion as it approaches
completion.</p>

<p>This applies not only to Greek coins but to every class. Thus,
for instance, there are collectors of English coins who confine
their attention to the Anglo-Saxon period; others who will buy
no coins later than the reign of Charles I.; and others, again,
who only collect the copper money of the last two centuries.</p>

<p>The young collector who would not drift into unprofitable
<i>dilettanteism</i> should therefore select some one series and keep to
it, and it is chiefly with the view of assisting him to make his
choice of a field to work upon that these pages have been written.</p>

<p>It will be well to form some idea, in the first instance, of the
numerous series which are included in the general term of “<i>Greek
coins</i>.”</p>

<p>Greek coins may be divided into three principal sections:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. <i>Autonomous</i>, <i>i.e.</i> coins issued by cities governed by their
own laws.</p>

<p>B. <i>Regal</i>, <i>i.e.</i> coins struck in the names of kings.</p>

<p>C. <i>Imperial</i>, <i>i.e.</i> coins of Greek cities struck in Roman
Imperial times, and with the head of the Emperor on the obverse.</p>

<p>And into eight chronological periods as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 700-480. <i>Period of Archaic Art</i>, ending with the
Persian wars.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 480-430. <i>Period of Transitional Art</i>, between the
Persian and Peloponnesian wars.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 430-400. <i>Period of Early Fine Art</i>, to the end of
the Athenian supremacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
IV. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 400-336. <i>Period of Finest Art.</i> Age of the Spartan
and Theban supremacies. Philip of Macedon.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 336-280. <i>Period of Later Fine Art.</i> Age of Alexander
and his immediate successors.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 280-197. <i>Period of the Decline of Art.</i> Age of the
Epigoni or descendants of Alexander’s successors.</p>

<p>VII. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 197-27. <i>Period of Late Decline of Art.</i> Age of
the Attalids, Mithradates, and of the Roman supremacy.</p>

<p>VIII. <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 27&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 268. <i>Period of Latest Decline of Art.</i>
The Empire. Augustus&mdash;Gallienus.</p>


<h3>§ OF THE METALS OF WHICH COINS ARE
COMPOSED.</h3>

<p>The coins of the ancients were of various metals, of which the
following need only be specified.</p>


<p>1. <i>Gold</i>, distinguished in numismatic works by the abbreviation
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="20" height="16" alt="[AU]" /> (for aurum).</p>

<p>2. <i>Electrum</i>, a compound of gold and silver. EL.</p>

<p>3. <i>Silver.</i> AR (argentum).</p>

<p>4. <i>Billon</i> and <i>Potin</i>, alloys of silver and bronze. Bil. and Pot.</p>

<p>5. <i>Bronze.</i> Copper with a percentage of tin. Æ (æs).</p>


<h3>§ OF THE TERMS USED TO DEFINE THE VARIOUS
PARTS OF A COIN.</h3>

<p>The front or face of a coin is called the <i>obverse</i>. Obv.</p>

<p>The back is called the <i>reverse</i>. Rev.</p>

<p>The principal device or object represented on a coin is called
the <i>type</i>.</p>

<p>The area or space between the type and the circumference is
called the <i>field</i>.</p>

<p>The lower portion of the area of a coin beneath the type and
separated from the rest of the field by a horizontal line is called
the <i>exergue</i>. Ex.</p>

<p>Small objects represented either in the field or the exergue as
adjuncts to the main type are called <i>symbols</i>.</p>

<p>Portions of a coin which are sunk below the level of the
surface are said to be <i>incuse</i>.</p>


<h3>§ OF THE TYPES OF GREEK COINS.</h3>

<p>The types of Greek coins were from the earliest times down
to the age of the successors of Alexander almost exclusively
religious. The reason for this is not far to seek. In an age of
simple faith the head of a god upon the coin was the best of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
guarantees for purity of metal and good weight. The gods
were, so to speak, invoked by the State to vouch for the good
quality of its currency, in the same way as State decrees often
began with the formula “<i>In the name of the gods</i>.” There is,
moreover, some reason to think that the earliest coins were struck
within the sacred precincts of the Temple treasuries, as being
holy places, secure from plunder and inviolable.</p>

<p>In the most ancient period the principal or obverse type is
generally some animal or object sacred to or emblematical of
that god whose worship was prevalent in the city in which the
coin was issued. Subsequently the head of the deity himself
was usually placed upon the obverse of the coin, while the reverse
side was occupied by the object emblematical of his
worship. Frequently, too, the head of one principal deity appears
upon the obverse, and, either the entire figure or the emblem of
some other, generally local divinity, on the reverse.</p>

<p>The chief exceptions to the above rule are the so-called
<i>agonistic types</i>, or types referring to the games such as the victorious
quadriga on the money of various Sicilian cities. These
types are commemorative in a general way of victories in the
Olympian or other local games, but it is hardly ever possible to
refer them to any particular victory.</p>

<p>Victories in war and political revolutions are never directly
referred to on Greek coins, although the unintentional records
of such events may often be traced in a sudden change of coin-types.
Thus, for instance, at Syracuse when the Corinthians
succeeded in liberating that city from the tyranny of the Dionysian
dynasty, the coinage of Syracuse is for a time assimilated
to that of Corinth; a still clearer indication of restored freedom
at the same time (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 345) being seen in the first introduction
of the head of Zeus “the Liberator” upon the coins of Syracuse.</p>

<p>All through the history of free and independent Greece, the
original idea of the religious character of the coinage may be
traced. The coinage was everywhere placed under the auspices
of the gods, and gods, heroes, and their emblems, were alone
considered worthy to be represented upon it. No tyrant, however
despotic, not even the great Dionysius of Syracuse, would
have dreamed of placing his own head upon the coinage of the
State. Even Philip of Macedon, when he had united in his single
hand the whole of Northern Greece, and when he reorganized
the coinage of his empire on a new model, placed on his gold
money the head of Apollo and on his silver that of Zeus.</p>

<p>It was reserved for the successors of Alexander the Great,
when the political centre of the Greek world was no longer to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
found in Greece itself, but in the various capitals of the powerful
semi-oriental monarchies which arose out of the ruins of the
Persian empire&mdash;Alexandria, Antioch, etc.&mdash;it was reserved for
these self-constituted kings and their descendants to substitute
their own heads for those of the gods.</p>

<p>Such an innovation as this, such a complete upsetting of the
ancient deeply rooted idea of the connection between the gods
and the coinage could not be introduced all at once. It had to
be effected by degrees. Alexander the Great even in his lifetime
gave himself out as the son of Zeus Ammon, and after his
death the idea of his divinity gained ground year by year. The
first step towards the new fashion of placing the king’s head
upon the coinage was made by Lysimachus of Thrace, who introduced
on his money the portrait of the deified Alexander in
the character of the son of Ammon with the ram’s horn over the
ear.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Soter, king of Egypt, the first of the dynasty which
ruled Egypt for two centuries and a half after the death of Alexander,
was the first monarch who placed his own head upon his
coins. By slow degrees his example was followed, first in Asia
and finally in Europe, where Philip V. of Macedon, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 220,
was the first king whose portrait in the character of a mortal, and
not disguised as a demi-god, appears upon the coinage.</p>

<p>The influence of the old religious beliefs nevertheless maintained
so firm a hold on men’s minds that the reverses of Greek
coins continued to bear sacred types throughout the Roman Imperial
period; and even on the money of the Byzantine emperors
when Christianity had become the State religion, the figures of
Christ and the Virgin, or the sign of the Cross, still bear witness
that the same religious sanction in a new form continued to be
invoked for the coin of the realm.</p>


<h3>§ THE GODS AS REPRESENTED ON THE
COINAGE.</h3>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Zeus</span> (<span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>). The head of this god is almost always bearded
and crowned with laurel or olive <a href="#i_105a1.jpg">(Fig. 1</a>). The youthful
head called Zeus Hellenios, on certain coins of Syracuse, is
however beardless, and but for the inscription which in this
case accompanies it, would be indistinguishable from a head
of Apollo.</p>

<p><i>Zeus Ammon</i> <a href="#i_105a1.jpg">(Fig. 2</a>), frequent on coins of Cyrene, is
distinguished by the ram’s horn behind the ear. This god
is sometimes beardless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

by her many breasts.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span> (<span class="smcap">Venus</span>). On the coins of Eryx, in Sicily, the
goddess of love is seated fully draped, with Eros (Cupid) as
a youth (not a child, as in Roman art) standing before her,
and with a dove in her hand. On Imperial coins of Cnidu,
the famous naked Aphrodite by Praxiteles was represented.
As the goddess of heaven (<i>Aphrodite Urania</i>), she sits upon
the globe <a href="#i_112b1.jpg">(Fig. 46 <i>a</i>)</a>, her head surmounted by the morning
star, and holding in her hand a sceptre. On the reverse
of the same coin <a href="#i_112b1.jpg">(Fig. 46 <i>b</i>)</a> are seen the sun, the moon,
and the five planets.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Cybele.</span> “The mother of the gods” wears a turreted crown.
Sometimes she rides upon a lion, at other times she is
seated on a throne between two lions. The rabbit is also
symbolical of her worship, as an earth goddess.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Isis.</span> This Egyptian goddess is recognised by her peculiar
head-dress, consisting of a globe or disc flanked by two
cow’s horns and surmounted by two ostrich feathers. In
her hand she often holds the sistrum (a musical instrument).
As Isis Pharia (a sea goddess) she holds a sail.</p>

(Figs. <a href="#i_113_1.jpg">47, 48</a>). This divinity is almost always
winged, and often flying (<i>see <a href="#i_097_small.jpg">Frontispiece</a></i>). She usually
carries a wreath; and on coins of Alexander the Great a
sort of mast with a cross-yard (the stand for a trophy of
arms). Sometimes she is nailing armour to a trophy <a href="#i_113_1.jpg">(Fig.

<h3>§ SYMBOLS.</h3>

<p>In addition to the principal type, whether of the obverse or
of the reverse, there is generally to be seen on the coins of Greek
states a subordinate adjunct device, which occupies some vacant
space in the field of the coin. These additions to the main type
are of two kinds:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Symbols connected more or less directly with the main
type: such as the sacred olive branch on the coins of Athens, and
the club and bow on <a href="#i_108c1.jpg">Fig. 24</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
(2) Symbols having no connection whatever with the principal
type; such as the small animal on <a href="#i_106a1.jpg">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>The symbols of the 1st class are naturally limited in number
and more or less constant accompaniments of the main type,
to which they were intended to give greater precision and
definiteness of meaning. Those of the 2nd class, on the other
hand, might be varied very frequently on coins of one and the
same series. There can be no doubt that such symbols were
the distinctive badges or signets of one of the magistrates or
moneyers under whose authority the coinage was issued. The
frequency with which these personal symbols were varied corresponds
with the duration of the term of office of the magistrate
in question, whether annual or other.</p>

<p>On the regal coinages from the time of Philip of Macedon
onwards, in cases where a uniform coinage was issued at many
mints, an adjunct symbol was very generally placed in the field
of the coin as a mint-mark designating the place of issue (<i>e.g.</i>
the Trident on <a href="#i_105b1.jpg">Fig. 4</a>). It is frequently impossible to distinguish
such local mint-marks from the personal signets of the
officer entrusted by the king with the supervision of the currency.</p>


<h3>§ INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

<p>The inscriptions on Greek coins may be divided into the
following principal classes:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
     <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The name of the people or state.</li>
     <li>&nbsp;(ii) The name of the chief of the state, whether tyrant or king.</li>
     <li>(iii) The name of a magistrate.</li>
     <li>&nbsp;(iv) The name of the engraver of the die.</li>
     <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) A legend referring to the type.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above are written sometimes at full length and sometimes
in an abbreviated form, or in the form of a more or less
complicated monogram.</p>

<p>Those of class i., when written in full, are usually in the
genitive plural, <i>e.g.</i> ΣΤΡΑΚΟΣΙΟΝ  <a href="#i_097_small.jpg">(Frontispiece)</a>.</p>

<p>Those of class ii. are also in the genitive, <i>e.g.</i>, ΒΑΣΙΛΑΕΩΣ
ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΥ <a href="#i_106a1.jpg">(Fig. 8)</a>.</p>

<p>Those of class iii. are either in the nominative (as ΠΟΛΥΚΡΑΤΗΣ,
<a href="#i_112a1.jpg">Fig. 45</a>) or the genitive; in the latter case frequently
preceded by ΕΗΙ <a href="#i_107a1.jpg">(Fig. 12)</a>, and often also accompanied by the
title of the office as ἑφι Λυσιστῥατου ἁρχοντος, ἑφι στραθηγου
Διονυσἱου.</p>

<p>Among the magistrates most frequently mentioned on Greek
Imperial coins are the following:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
The Archon, the Strategos (Prætor), the Grammateus (Secretary),
the Prytanis, the Tamias (Treasurer), the Archiereus and
Hiereus (High Priest and Priest), the Asiarch, the Hypatos
(Consul), and the Anthypatos (Proconsul), etc., etc.</p>

<p>Those of class iv. are in the genitive, except when accompanied
by the verb (<i>e.g.</i> ΘΕΟΔΟΤΟΣ ΕΠΟΕΙ, for ἑποἱει).
This class of inscriptions is usually in very minute characters.</p>

<p>Those of class v. are in the nominative, as ΖΕΥΣ ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΟΣ
<a href="#i_105a1.jpg">(Fig. 1</a>), or genitive, as ΑΡΕΟΣ <a href="#i_109a1.jpg">(Fig. 28)</a>.</p>

<p>The names of kings, even when unaccompanied by the title
ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ, hold so conspicuous a position on the reverse of the
coins, that it is easy to distinguish them from the names of
less important monetary magistrates.</p>

<p>The names of eponymous magistrates, such as archons, etc.,
also occupy a very prominent place on the money of certain
cities; such as Ephesus, for example.</p>

<p>The names of less important functionaries are written in an
abbreviated form or even in monogram <a href="#i_111b1.jpg">(Fig. 40)</a>, in which latter
case it is almost always impossible to say what name was
intended.</p>

<p>On coins of the later and especially of the Imperial period, the
inscriptions are much more lengthy than on those of an earlier
date.</p>


<h3>§ OF THE METHOD OF DATING COINS.</h3>

<p>Dates are not found on Greek coins before the age of Alexander
the Great, and even after his time they are of rare occurrence,
except on certain Asiatic series and on the money
of Egypt. They are usually placed either in the field or the
exergue of the coin.</p>

<p>They are sometimes preceded by the word ΕΤΟΥΣ, thus,
 ΕΤΟΥΣ ΡΚΔ = <i>Anno</i> 124. On the coinage of Egypt, both
under the Ptolemies and under the Roman Emperors, the
character [L] is used instead of the word ΕΤΟΥΣ, thus, ΛΓ =
<i>Anno</i> 33. This character was probably an ancient Egyptian
symbol meaning <i>year</i>, adopted into the Greek system of
numeration for the sake of brevity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
The following are a few of the many epochs or <i>æras</i> according
to which coins are dated:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>The Seleucid æra begins B.C. 312.</li>
<li>The Pompeian &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.C. 63.</li>
<li>The Cæsarian &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.C. 48 or 47.</li>
<li>The Augustan or Actian æra begins B.C. 31.</li>
</ul>


<h3>§ OF THE DENOMINATIONS OF GREEK COINS.</h3>

<p>The unit of account in Greece was the <i>drachm</i>. The weight
of the drachm was not everywhere identical. It ranged, as a
rule, between about 55 and 95 grs. troy. For purposes of calculation
it may be taken in a general way as the ancient equivalent
of our modern shilling or franc.</p>

<p>Of the various standards of weight which prevailed in different
parts of the Greek world, the <i>Attic standard</i> was the most widely
diffused. The weights of the various denominations, according
to this standard, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The other standards are the <i>Æginetic</i> (drachm 97 grs.); the
<i>Phœnician</i> (drachm 56 grs.); the <i>Rhodian</i> (drachm 60 grs.);
the <i>Persian</i> (drachm 88 grs.). The other denominations of the
above standards may be easily got at by multiplying or dividing
the drachms as in the Attic standard.</p>

<p>Larger denominations than the tetradrachm are rare, but
octadrachms, decadrachms, etc., etc., occur at some towns.
The unit in copper was called the <i>chalkous</i>; but its weight does
not appear to have been definitely fixed like that of the silver
drachm.</p>

<p>The Attic gold money was regulated according to the same
standard of weight as the silver. The gold unit of account was,
however, not the drachm, but the <i>stater</i>, as it was called, equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in weight to the didrachm, and in value to 20 drachms of
silver.</p>

<p>As a rule, the denomination of a Greek coin can only be determined
by weighing it. Marks of value occur, however, on
the copper of Italy, Sicily, etc.; but these coins follow a system
foreign to Greece proper (see below).</p>

<p>The above list, although an outline of the barest description,
may serve to give some idea of the ground which is covered by a
collection of Greek and cognate coins.</p>

<p>It will also serve to warn the young collector against buying
in a miscellaneous manner.</p>

<p>Let him take up some particular province; say, for example,
Sicily, in which there were some fifty towns which struck coins.
He will soon find that the numismatics of these fifty towns will
be a field for study which will amply reward him for the labour
he bestows upon it.</p>


<h3>§ OF THE PRICES OF GREEK COINS.</h3>

<p>The prices which Greek coins fetch at sales depend upon their
rarity, their state of preservation, and their size, not much upon
the artistic or the historical interest, or upon the metal of which
they are composed. Thus, a gold coin of Alexander the Great,
being common, may be obtained almost at metal value, while a
rare copper coin of some obscure town in the heart of Phrygia
may cost almost as many pounds as the gold coin of Alexander
does shillings.</p>

<h2><a name="II_ROMAN_COINS" id="II_ROMAN_COINS"></a>II. ROMAN COINS.</h2>

<h3>§ GENERAL CLASSIFICATION.</h3>


<p>The coins of ancient Rome are not artistically as interesting as
those of Greece. They are, however, most useful for all who desire
to become acquainted with the history and institutions of the
eternal city.</p>

<p>They may be divided into the following classes:&mdash;</p>


<h4><i>Coins of the Republic.</i></h4>

<p>I. Heavy Bronze coins cast in a mould, <i>Æs Grave</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
II. The so-called <i>Consular</i> or <i>Family</i> series, consisting of silver
and bronze struck coins, together with a few gold pieces.</p>


<h4><i>Coins of the Empire.</i></h4>

<p>III. Gold and silver, struck by the authority of the Emperor.</p>

<p>IV. Bronze (commonly called Large, Middle, and Small Brass),
struck by authority of the Senate, and distinguishable by the
letters S. C. (Senatus-Consulto).</p>

<p>V. Imperial medallions in all metals, not intended to circulate
as money.</p>


<h3>§ OF THE ÆS GRAVE.</h3>

<p>(1) The <i>æs grave</i> was the earliest money used in Rome and
throughout the central and northern parts of the Italian peninsula.
It consisted of the As (or unit) and its divisions and
multiples, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" summary="THE ÆS GRAVE">

<tr><td class="tdl">As. </td><td class="tdl"><i>Obv.</i> Head of Janus;</td>
    <td class="tdl"><i>Rev.</i> Prow of ship. </td><td class="tdl">Mark of value</td>
    <td class="tdc">I</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Semis (1/2 As). </td><td class="tdl"><i>Obv.</i> Hd. of Jupiter</td>

    <td class="tdl"> &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pallas</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc"><b>....</b></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Quadrans (1/4 As).</td>
    <td class="tdl"><i>Obv.</i> Head of Hercules</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>

<tr><td class="tdl">Uncia (1/12 As).</td>
    <td class="tdl"> &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Roma</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc"><b>.</b></td></tr>
</table></div>

<h4>MULTIPLES OF THE AS.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" summary="MULTIPLES OF THE AS">

<tr><td class="tdl">Dupondius (2 Asses).</td>
    <td class="tdl"> <i>O.</i> Hd. of Pallas;</td>
    <td class="tdl"><i>R.</i> Prow of ship.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Mark of value</td>
    <td class="tdr">II</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Tripondius (3 Asses).</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>

    <td class="tdr">III</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Decussis (10 Asses).</td>
    <td class="tdl"><i>O.</i> Head of Roma.</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdr">X</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The above types are those of the coins of Rome itself. The
æs grave of the other Italian states had different types.</p>

<p>The As first issued in Rome is said to have weighed one pound,
hence it was called the As Libralis. The earliest known specimens
of the Libral series date from about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 400. As time went
on, it was gradually reduced in weight, at first to 4 ounces, about
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 268 (<i>Triental Reduction</i>), and subsequently, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 217, to
1 ounce (<i>Uncial Reduction</i>), and somewhat later even to ½ an
ounce.</p>


<h3>§ OF THE SILVER “CONSULAR” COINAGE.</h3>

<p>(2) Silver money was first struck in Rome about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 268.
It consisted of the following denominations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" summary= "SILVER CONSULAR COINAGE">

<tr><td class="tdl">The Denarius (= 10 Asses).</td>
    <td class="tdl"><i>Obv.</i> Head of Roma;<br /><i>Rev.</i> The Dioscuri.</td>
    <td class="tdl">Mark of value</td>
    <td class="tdr">X</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">The Quinarius (= 5 Asses).</td>
    <td class="tdl">Similar types</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdr">V or Q</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">The Sestertius (= 2½ Asses).</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdc">"</td>
    <td class="tdr">IIS</td></tr>

</table></div>


<p>Afterwards another denomination called the Victoriatus was added:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<i>Obv.</i> Head of Jupiter; <i>Rev.</i> Victory crowning a trophy. This was
a coin of Campanian origin, and its value was ¾ of the denarius.
The types of the silver money, at first constant and uniform, were
subsequently varied according to the pleasure of the officers entrusted
with the supervision of the coinage. The types of the
Roman denarii of the last century of the Republic generally contain
allusions to past (but never or very rarely to contemporary)
events connected with the family of the moneyer. Hence such
pieces may be called Family coins, but to give this name to the
whole series of Republican denarii is incorrect.</p>

<p>At first it is supposed that the direction of the Roman mint
was entrusted to the Consuls themselves, but it was not long
before special magistrates were appointed from time to time to
superintend the currency. These Triumviri or Tresviri Monetales
were officially designated as Tresviri auro argento aere
flando feriundo, a title abbreviated on some coins to IIIVIR.
A. A. A. F. F. The adjective Monetalis referred to the temple
of Juno Moneta, in which the mint was situated, and from this
epithet of Juno our modern word “Money” is derived.</p>

<p>It is usual, though not strictly scientific, to arrange a cabinet of
Roman Republican denarii under the <i>family</i> names of the moneyers,
in alphabetical order. As the family name does not always
occur upon the coin, the following table of surnames and
of the families to which they belong will be found useful to the
young collector in arranging his coins.</p>

<h3>§ OF THE MONEY OF THE EMPIRE.</h3>

<p>(3 and 4.) Imperial coins. The Imperial series may be
said to commence in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 2, when Augustus was made Pater
Patriæ. From this time forward the names of the moneyers
cease to appear on the coinage.</p>

<p>The portrait of the emperor, or of some member of the Imperial
family, now almost always occupies the obverse of the
coin. The reverse type is, as a general rule, some allegorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
figure, such as Spes, Justitia, Salus, Pietas, etc., etc., or the
representation of some one of the many provinces of the empire,
<i>e.g.</i> Britannia, Judæa, etc., or again some military subject,
<i>e.g.</i> legionary standards, or the emperor addressing his soldiers,
together with a great variety of types, to mention which would
occupy far more space than we have here at our disposal.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on the Imperial coins contain in an abbreviated
form the date of their issue, calculated by the number of
times which the Tribunitia Potestas, or Tribunitian power, had
been conferred upon the emperor. This office was renewed
annually on the first day of January. The formula is <span class="f90">TR. POT.</span>
or <span class="f90">TR. P.</span>, followed by a numeral, as, on a coin of Trajan,
<span class="f90">TR. P. XX. COS. VI. IMP. XI.</span> This means that the coin was
struck when the emperor was in the possession of the Tribunitian
power for the 20th time, of the consulship for the 6th time,
and of the Imperatorship for the 11th time. Now, as Trajan
had the Tribunitian power for the first time in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 98, we get
the date <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 116 for the coin in question. The other offices
mentioned were not annual.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the Roman emperors, and other
members of the Imperial families, arranged in the order in
which it is usual to classify their coins, which is, as far as possible,

<p>The above list is not quite complete, even as far as it goes, but
it includes the names of all the emperors whose coins are at all
likely to be met with by the young collector.</p>

<p>The series of the large brass coins, which is more interesting
than the others, ceases after the reign of Postumus.</p>


<h3>§ ROMAN MEDALLIONS.</h3>

<p>(5) Imperial medallions. As illustrations of the life and religion
of the Romans under the Empire, as well as of the history
of the times, no numismatic monuments which have come down
to us can compete with the large bronze medallions. They are
to be distinguished from the current large brass coins by the
absence of the letters s.c. (<i>senatus consulto</i>), as well as usually
by their larger size, higher relief, and finer work. As, however,
the prices fetched by good medallions are, as a rule, very
high, they are practically out of the reach of the collector of
moderate means.</p>


<h3>§ HOW TO DISTINGUISH TRUE FROM FALSE
COINS.</h3>

<p>The young collector will not be long before he learns that a
large number of the coins exposed for sale in shop windows are
false, and at first he may be a little discouraged by finding that
he is himself quite unable to discriminate between a true coin
and a false one. But let him not despair. He will in time, by
careful observation of undoubtedly authentic specimens of the
class which he has selected for study, gain a kind of instinct
which will enable him to detect the modern imitation at a glance,
even though he may not always be able to explain his reasons
to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>False coins may be divided into the following classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Forgeries struck from false modern dies.</i> Such forgeries,
when the dies have been well executed by men familiar with the
characteristic peculiarities of ancient work, are often exceedingly
difficult to detect, especially when they are of gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The true ancient patina and oxide which time alone gives to
bronze and silver, cannot be exactly imitated.</p>

<p>A few hints may be of use in the detection of false struck
coins.</p>

<p>The weight, owing to the ignorance of the forger, is generally
incorrect.</p>

<p>The style of the art is weak, and the forms of the letters
especially are timid and wanting in firmness.</p>

<p>II. <i>Modern casts made from ancient struck originals.</i> A cast
coin, when in gold or silver, may always be detected by its light
weight, unless this has been compensated for by making the cast
thicker than the original. The lettering and the types on cast
coins are also less sharply defined than on struck coins, and the
surface has either a soft and soapy appearance, or else it is covered
with minute sand-holes, an infallible indication of rough
casting. The genuine patina of bronze coins is imitated by
paint, which can be removed by spirits of wine.</p>

<p>III. <i>Electrotypes.</i> These are of necessity of wrong weight.
They may also be known by the edges, where the mark of joining
of the two sides separately made and then stuck together,
is never concealed, unless, which is seldom the case, the electrotype
is intended to deceive. Many students who cannot afford
to buy originals of rare coins, supply their places by electrotypes,
which, as they are exact facsimiles, do not spoil the eye,
as too much familiarity with false coins undoubtedly does.
Electrotypes may generally be split in two with a strong knife.</p>

<p>IV. Original coins which have been altered with a graving
tool may be classed as forgeries, and should be avoided, as
there is no telling to what extent they may have been “restored.”</p>


<h3>§ THE COIN CABINET.</h3>

<p>Coins should be kept under lock and key in a mahogany
cabinet. Trays made of cedar should never be used, as there is
a deposit from this wood which covers the surface of copper and
lead coins with a kind of varnish which is difficult to remove.
In arranging coins in the trays, begin at the left hand top
corner, placing the coins in rows, one in each hole. Under
every coin there should be a descriptive card or a number referring
to a catalogue, in which the price paid for every specimen
should be carefully recorded, as well as the name of the persons
from whom it was acquired. A coin from a well-known cabinet
will always fetch more when sold than an equally fine specimen
of which the antecedents are unknown.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
